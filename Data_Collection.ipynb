    "## Song Lyrics Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Overcoming writers block and writing creative lyrics is difficult task for most musicians, which leads to frustration and feeling \"stuck\". For this project, I am hoping to create a text generation model that predicts the next word, couple words, or line of text for a new song in order to help musicians create awesome new lyrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposed Method and Models\n",
    "- Gpt-2 to train my model -- Depending on the output, it would be interesting to let the user select a single artist they want their lyrics to sound like (MVP). It would also be interesting if I pulled from Spotify a list of similar artists and grouped them together to create another model, showcasing my ability to cluster. In addition, I could also create a generator by genre (which would require me to get a list of the top songs by genre and train a model for each)\n",
    "- Flask App\n",
    "- NLP\n",
    "- AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks and Assumptions of My Data\n",
    "- Will have a large variety of artists and the lyrics to each of their songs\n",
    "- I could have duplicates of the same song\n",
    "- Song lyrics can be abstract, which I am not sure yet how that might affect my model\n",
    "- The score of the model can be subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Goals and Success Criteria\n",
    "- Predict either the next word, words, or line of a song based on an text input from the user\n",
    "- Consider using a BLEURT Score as a metric of success - https://medium.com/@jrodthoughts/googles-bleurt-is-bert-for-evaluating-natural-language-generation-models-fa0ce898c38a.\n",
    "- Give the user multiple options for the next word(s), score on the number of accepted recommendations\n",
    "- Rhyme (stretch)\n",
    "- Write an original song with > 50% of the lyrics computer generated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Data Source and EDA\n",
    "I plan to pull a handful more artists and add them as csvs. With the function below, the biggest hurdle is the amount of time is takes to scrape the large pulls of data, but it is a repeatable process that I could let run during off hours. I have not fully decided if I am going to integrate the Spotify API data, which is why I've tried to pull the `spotify_url` from the songs below. I may be able to look up by the `id` or worst case can use the `artist_name` with the `title` . "
