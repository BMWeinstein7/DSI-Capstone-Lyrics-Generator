John Mayer,"Ah, ah, ah
Ah...

I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

Yeah, if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Ooh, yeah Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees


Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?

Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?

My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room

Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow? She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin'

I want to glide down over Mulholland
I want to write her, her name in the sky
I want to free fall out into nothing
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while

Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Yeah, yeah How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood? A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be


And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But, I just can't sleep on this tonight

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?


So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said, ""Help me understand""
He said, ""Turn 68, you'll renegotiate""

""Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train""

Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark

Singing, ""Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause, now, I see, I'll never stop this train"" Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

It's taken me so long just to say ""so long""
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man

The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man, oh mama
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man, your man

(Ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met)
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, be—

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
(I still feel like) Still feel like your man (oh honey)
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man (And I don't know why)
Still feel like your man

I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still, I still One, two. One, two, three

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change


And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change Rosie
Come down and get the door for me
I'm drunk again, remember when we used to be?
Rosie
I know you said no more for me
But that was all before this dream that just came to me

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see, I learned those words for you

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll


Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall? I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't know what it's like to land
And not race to your door
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key
And your bedroom neighborhood
And be sleepwalking in Hollywood

I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'd get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me
""I love you, take a right""
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight

I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I think I'm going to stay
Going to stay in the gray
Think I'm going to stay
And all the street lights say
""Never mind, never mind""
And the canyon lines say
""Never mind, never mind""
The sunset says
""We see this all the time""
Never mind, never you mind

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar Oh honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do

Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

Oh honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good

It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be ok
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
Until it's gone It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it

You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

Oh, love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)

I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend) Young and full of running
Tell me where has that taken me
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

So young and full of running
All the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming
I have to have you now
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
And find me on yours

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands) ""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat
Take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding
Up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light

Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for

Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Where the sun hits my face all different
Carry me away
Carry me away Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me, in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long time since 22
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember, don't remember you No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby, kiss me, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out

Oh, we don't have forever
Baby, daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out, oh
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing
Oh, baby, take me, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out

I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me girl XO
You love me like XO
Is all that I see
Giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

Oh, in the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year

But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”

But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other

So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning No, I'm not the man I used to be, lately
See, you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside

Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

I will beg my way into your garden
And then I'll break my way out, when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)

Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

Who do you love?
Girl I see through, through your love
Who do you love; me or the thought of me?
Me or the thought of me?


Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you The same drink that gets me out the door
Is the same drink that puts me on the floor
And the new thing I wanna try some more
Is the same mistake I used to make before

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

The same brain that brings me ecstacy
Is the same pain that gets the best of me
And the one I love the most just said to me
A broken heart is all I'll ever be

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

Help me
Help me
Help me

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out
If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
Then I'll stop trying to figure it out When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away Walt Grace
Desperately hating his whole place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive
Inside his basement
Tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive

Because when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try

But with the will to work hard
And a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home
From dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone

Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide

And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo

Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side

And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay

Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Why? Why Georgia, why? When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my, roses in my hands?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t
‘Cause you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
Verse 
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all

It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
And if you’re further up the road
Can you show me what I still can’t see?
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find

Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?

Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily

Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside

Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for

Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?


We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for

What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from goin' under?

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me


Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, now

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't you give up
Don't give up, give up, give up Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems
Better put 'em in quotations

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Walking like a one man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You'd better know that in the end
It's better to say too much
Than never say what you need to say again
Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing
Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own
Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways
I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing

Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing


I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing
Changing River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history


I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag It's really over, you made your stand
You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through

I'm going to find another you

You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue

I'm going to find another you

When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too

So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for someone new
I'm going to do some things you wouldn't let me do

Oh
I'm going to find another you Waiting on the day
Where my thoughts are my own
When this house is my home
And plans are made

When you'll be there for me babe
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waiting on the day

When my life on the run
Bleaches out in the sun
And shows my age
I'm waiting on the day
When that voice comes to say
It's not wrong what you did
For just a kid

When you'll be there for me babe
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waiting on the day

Waiting on the day
When these words are in stone
When the kids are all grown
And we go dancing

Oh can you do it babe?
Can you love me all the way?
Will you tie me tight in little strands of paradise?
Will you walk with me before the morning fades?

I'm waiting on the day
Come back
Come back in our home
Come back in our home
Come back in our home One last drink to drink wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in
Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny, metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow, in this case, is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

I'm bold, bold as love
Yeah I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Just ask the axis
Yeah he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows everything


I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking to you
I'm bold, bold as love, yeah It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might have strayed a bit too far
I'm counting all the moonlit stars

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

Somedays, I think it's all okay
Some nights, I throw it all away
I saw her face and I could tell
My ghost had left the town as well

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

Maybe I'm a runaway train
Maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane
Maybe it's a long play game
But maybe that's a good thing

But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

Keep on running until my run is gone
Keep on riding until I see that dawn
And I will be found
I will be found I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo

By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
When all I got's
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to

Was there a second of time that I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you, oh?

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever, yeah
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't
And it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame
I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down


If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote ""Blue"" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down I work in the dead of night
When the roads are quiet and no one is around
To track my moves, racing the yellow lights
To find the gate is open, she's waiting in the room
I just slip on through

You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

Enter the morning light
To find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
In a little white room
No I'm not alone, her head is heavy on me
She's sleeping like a child
What could I do?

You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

Suddenly I'm in over my head and I can hardly breathe
Suddenly I'm floating over her bed and I feel everything
Suddenly I know exactly what I did, but I can not move a thing
And suddenly I know exactly what I'd done
And what it's going to mean to me, mean to me
I'm gone

I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin and she had a job to do I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?


I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

Mmm, yeah, yeah Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time

I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find

There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side

I'm thinking something like Olivia
Could keep me through the night


Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say, I'd let her in

Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

I keep thinking something like Olivia
Is what I need to find

Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh

Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While doing everything wrong
Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls

Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, why should I care?""
Ooh! Ooh!

No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
Dream your dreams, but don't pretend
Make friends with what you are
Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
Because God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it

Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, why should I care?""

Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, get out of here"" Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right

Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me

Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me

Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

I'm never really ready
Oh I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there The summer's over
This town is closing
They're waving people out of the ocean
We have the feeling like we were floating
We never noticed where time was going
Do you remember when we first got here
The days were longer, the nights were hot here
Now, it's September; the engine's starting
You're empty-handed and heavy-hearted

But just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while, but you'd be fine
Another good time coming down the line

You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating
Grass is greener: that makes two


Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
It don't come often, and it don't stay long

But just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run, get off the grid
Hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find that you're running is done
A little bit of Heaven never hurt no one Now that we are over as the loving kind
We'll be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
Only when we want is not a compromise
I'd be pouring tears into your drying eyes

Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

You whisper, come on over
Cause you're two drinks in
But in the morning, I will say goodbye again
Think we'll never fall into the jealous game
The streets are flood with blood of those who felt the same

Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

Friends, lovers, or nothing
We can really only ever be one
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We'll never be the inbetween
So give it up
We'll never the inbetween
So give it up

Anything other than 'yes' is 'no'
Anything other than 'stay' is 'go'
Anything less than 'I love you' is lying... I just remembered, that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down, aisle 5
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave
Can't remember, what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say she's going to be good for you
They throw me, high fives
She says the bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party
And she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish
Miles from Coltrane

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
Say

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, ""Well anyway...""
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, another social casualty
Score one more for me

How could I forget
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon

We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess
With the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again

How could I forget
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one

I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now

One more thing
Why is it my fault
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
Just want to be liked
Just want to be funny
Looks like the joke's on me
So call me Captain Backfire

I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now And these days with the world getting colder
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I planned
Tonight we're gonna order in
Drinking wine and watching CNN
It's dark, I know
But then again
It's the brightest thing I've got

When I'm covered in rain, rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain

From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now, and now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back now
Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
Cause she's the brightest thing I got

Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain


And come December Lydia left
She mentioned something about it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree
And it's killing me
And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers around a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet
But it's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
When you say it's alright
You got your heart right

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight

All you need is love is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left

So maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I want to know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)

I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away

'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight) I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s

I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me

Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say

But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s No, I've not seen you this way before
Standing a mess at my door
Well, it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one until someone lets you down
You believed that all people are kind
And that you'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust
And she busted your crown
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I've been told
That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true
I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue
There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I have heard
There are some that avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away

There's a heart ticket train on the way
Waitin' to take you away
Will you please keep in mind
When it pulls into town
You're no one until someone lets you down
You're no one until someone lets you down I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home

Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

Home home
Home home
Home home
Home home I'm not alone
I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy, but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
And you never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test for loneliness
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Friends (check)
Money (check)
A well slept (check)
Opposite sex (check)
Guitar (check)
Microphone (check)
Messages waiting on me when I come home (check)

How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries? Here comes the cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You, enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee, see

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights on a black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me
Hey, hey

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just until St. Patrick's Day Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you’re right?
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see

I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest (honest)
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be

I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed
The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
""Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet""
Great, now it's raining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
And I've been hiding here for seven months or so

Hand me down my golden hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet-black, kick-back, lay down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big old empty arms
Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
What can I say
Hey, hey
The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long


The copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there, calling over those hills People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say ""move along""
Their minds say ""gotcha heart""
""Let's move it along""
Move it along

And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last
To love her

And you can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me

You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now

You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me (You can't love too much, one part of it)
(You can't love too much, one part of it)
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me
I believe
That my life's going to see the love I give return to me Had a little love, but I spread it thin
Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bad name for my game around town
Tore up my heart, and shut it down

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

I see friends around from time to time
When their ladies let them slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind
On all my younger times
I have to thank the wrongs that led me to a love so strong

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know her hairs are on my shirts

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

The day
She called up and came to me
Covered in rain
And dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through
When I said ""I love you""
Friday evening, we've been drinking
2 a.m., I swear I might propose
But we close the tab
Split a cab
And call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound
Of sirens

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

From the battery
To the gallery
It's the kind of thing you only see
In scented, glossy magazines

And I can't remember life before her name I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling
Hearing ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" on the radio

And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

Thinking about my brother, Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother, John
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling because I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well

And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

And most my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt

Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision? Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over
Over you
Something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeah
I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way

Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

Yeah
Should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah

Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be If I ever get around to living
I'm going to put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay
If I ever get around to living
It's going to be just like I dreamed
I'm going to take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free

If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away
Free
Free

Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, ""Come upstairs, you've got some work to do""

When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?

You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it
And you been spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never going to look the way you want it

I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy Just when I had you off my head
Your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
You say you want to try again
But I've tried everything but giving in

Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

I bought a ticket on a plane
And by the time it landed, you were gone again
I love you more than songs can say
But I can't keep running after yesterday, so

Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

We say goodbye
We say goodbye
We say goodbye

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing

It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words

Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's
Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard

Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb

Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb This is a call to the color-blind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind a horizon line
Tied up in something true

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Why is it not my time
What is there more to learn
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body now

Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
For my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I've got nobody
I'm carrying no load
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
I'm not hiding from nobody
Nobody’s hiding from me
I got that green light babe
I've got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I've got to keep moving on
I might go up to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don’t know Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest story line
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all

You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed (come on back to bed)

What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with

You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed

You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
Ninety-eight and six degrees of separation from you baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?

Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love Come out angels, come out ghosts
Come out darkness, bring everyone you know
I'm not running, and I'm not scared
I am waiting, and well prepared

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

I got a hammer, and a heart of glass
I got to know right now, which walls to smash
I got to pocket, got no pills
If fear hasn't killed me yet, then nothing will
All the suffering
And all the pain
Never left a name

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

No more suffering
No more pain
Never again

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on
So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on  Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Isn't supposed to make me feel alone

What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Well they’re celebrating broken things
I don’t want a world of broken things
You can tell something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
The mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway
The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
You were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes
Saying ""if my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now.""
Because everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
Why
I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How
I don't know how
I don't know how but
I just sit back and I see my way right through it
When the memories are ten feet tall
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Days are long and words are cruel
They won't get the best of you
Cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me, yeah yeah
Always been to me, yeah, yeah
Always been to me, yeah
Always, oh oh
Always been to me, yeah, yeah
Always been to me Don't know why Tori came by
But I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori had been driving around the town for a while
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why, but Tori just smiled
And mentioned something about how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding

She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do

Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye

Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the back seat inside
Sure it's so she can't look out behind at the road

She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do

Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye

Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure she's fine Staying home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor looking back on old love
Or lack thereof
After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinking was wrong
I'm jaded, I hate it

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here (get here)

Searching all my days just to find you
I'm not sure who I'm looking for
I'll know it when I see you
Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here, oh yeah

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

You'll be so good
You'll be so good for me This is my bar and you know it
You never came in here before I showed it to you
And now I see you walking through that door
With a dress that I've been waiting for
And I know what you're trying to do
And I know what you want me to say
Funny, I was thinking about you yesterday
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
I used to worship the ground you walked on
And you walked all over me
And you looked me in the eye and said goodbye
And you did it so casually
And I know what you're trying to do
'Cause I see who you're talking to
And you send your pretty little eyes my way
But oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
You can try, you can try
But I’m way to high to fight it anyway
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care, I didn't care
And I don't want someone, who don't want someone
Who wants someone all the way
And I don't want someone, who don't want someone
Who don't want someone to ever get away
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
You can try, you can try
But I’m way to high to fight it anyway
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care, I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight

Stop trying to figure it out
(you try to figure, you try to figure it out)
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be
The back porch poet with my book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never going to find the perfect rhyme
For ""heavier things"" It's just the strangest thing
I've seen your face somewhere
An early evening dream, a past life love affair

Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?

In all my reverie
I thought I felt us there
A feather in my hand
A flower in your hair

Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all? One, two
One, two, three

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, ""Now I'm born and raised""

Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
Because time is strange when you're born and raised

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, ""Now I'm born and raised"" Suppose I said
I am on my best behavior
There are times
I lose my worried mind

Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

Suppose I said
Colors change for no good reason
And words will go
From poetry to prose

Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

And I, in time, will come around
I always do for you

Suppose I said
You're my saving grace

Would you want me when I'm not myself
(My grace, myself, not myself, when I'm someone else)
Wait it out while I am someone else
(When I'm someone else, when I'm someone else, when I'm not myself)
Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else How sad it is that time should pass
Her Majesty, the hourglass
We take the sand of bygone years
And make mud of it with all our tears
What is now compared to then
And will I ever love again?
The answer to the answer brings
The endless search for everything I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord for mercy
Said, help me if you please
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
No one seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
That I'm standing at the crossroads
I believe I'm sinking down I think I'm going to stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow-mo
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm going to stay home

I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me 'cause my name isn't there

Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's going to be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life

Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

I can tell you this much
II will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change (home life doesn't change)

I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we both can talk, but
I've got to leave you cause my ride is here

In my home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise
Home life I promise
Life
Home life
Home life Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

I really did it to myself I guess
I saw you standing in that cocktail dress
Oh, call the press and say my life is a mess
Because I must confess to you

Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

Fool me once and it's shame on you
Twice it's shame on me
But fool me baby for the rest of my life
And I'll be happy, happy as a broken man can be

Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days

Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The TV is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change

Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors

Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days Once upon most every morning
I woke up to her flying there
Hummingbird was making blows of
Blowing rings of purple in the air
All the while
I was trying to keep her there
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That's all I heard
That's my hummingbird
Just because I said I didn't want her
Doesn't mean I want her to go
In fact, I quite depended on her
But that I didn't want her to know
Now that's she's gone I know
All the while
I was trying to keep her there, ya
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That song i heard, I heard
That's my Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Is it too late
Too late, hummingbird? I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby, yeah
I'm coming down with a misery

I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

No, no, no, I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled, yeah
Only my baby's arms could ever
Could ever take away this chill
Now the doctor say I need rest
For I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion, yeah


All I need is my baby, please!
Won't you please just come on home?
Come on home Do not waste this evening
Baby, I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leaving's something I'm going to do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

So hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

And you live like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold my love (hold my love)
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear I never will

Remember now
You, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Tell me pretty baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Sometimes it feels like someone took a knife
Baby do you know and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire, ooh ooh Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way, that's the highway, that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes through St. Louie, Joplin Missouri
Oklahoma City, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, Tulsa and Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes through St. Louie, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City, looks so so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, Tulsa and Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66 Go easy on me for the night has been long
I’m not quite as strong as you see me
I came here alone and I’ll leave on my own
The next stop is home so go easy on me
Oh, I don’t need your truth
Or a good talking-to from your mountain
No, I don’t know your name and I won’t take the blame
Don’t know what you need, so go easy on me
Go easy on me, for I mean you no harm
It’s possible charm is in order
But you make it so hard when you throw up your guard
I’m not here to spar so go easy on me
Oh, the clanging of swords
And the war of the words doesn’t move me
See, my heart barely works and it’s covered in dirt
It still kind of hurts, so go easy on me
Oh, I see in your eyes
You don’t realize what you’re doing
So, here’s some advice, never hurts to be nice
If you’re not going to be, then go easy on me
Go easy on me, go easy on me I'm a good man
In a dark room
In a big town
Under a full moon
It's a friday and I'm almost home
I'm in a good place
Full of head space
Got a brand new pack in my suitcase
But it's dinner and then it's bed alone
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
Gonna make it, like I need her
Gonna miss her the moment I meet her
And it's only gonna get worse from there
I'll be rappin' there in the shower
She'll be here by the end of the hour
I can do better
But I can't do better now
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
So long is over
Nice to skip the chance you get to know you
Why did I think this was true?
Because I want to
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
I wanna fall
I wanna need
I wanna laugh, cry, say goodbye
Beg, lie, cheat and steal Midnight
Lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night
There's not a sound
Outside the snow's coming down

And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

Three o' two
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears have cornered me here
Me and my TV screen
The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around

And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start and feet walk the halls
The world awakes and now I am safe
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day Six numbers, one more to dial
Before I'm before you
I tried to call
Been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me

Oh, oh, oh
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playing the part of the Queen
Taking my own advice, I'm giving up tonight
Good luck to you and the king

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know, life as the man
Living life as the man on the side Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
I tried to call been busy all night
Gave up waitin' at daylight

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me, if you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me, hey, hey

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Takin' my own advice
I'm givin' up tonight, good luck to you and the king

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free if you wanted me
When, when you wanted me
Ohh, when you wanted babe

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as a man, you know life as a man
Livin' life as a man on the side I know you've been sworn
I read your complaint
You're needing someone older
And though I've been warned to live day by day
There's something taking over
Did you expect to kiss me one time
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are

Your mother complains that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short, a minute early
But I am your man
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
It's what we are

Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
That we've been playing in tonight

I'm calling it love soon
I'm calling it love soon
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are Sometimes, I wish that I was the weather
You'd bring me up in conversation forever
And when it rained, I'd be the talk of the day
Oh, sometimes I wish that I was a cold beer
I'd rest assured that you would hold me near
I'd be guaranteed to be just what you need

And there could be no other way, because you're so, you're so lame
Your tired words are all, they're all the same
Yeah, I would walk and I'd surely walk away
If I wasn't such a sucker for you

Sometimes, I wish that I was a bong hit
You'd let me in and you would love every minute
And tell the room the things I did to you


I see your world with rosy colored glasses on
Want to right what I see wrong
I could never have that power over you
Someday, I'm got to pack up and leave this town
I'm got to get my own things going on
And when I do, I'll forget, I'll forget

I'll forget about how, how you're so, you're so lame
Your tired words are all, your tired words are all the same
And I would walk, you know I'd, I'd walk away
If I wasn't such a sucker for you
I wasn't such a sucker for you
I wasn't such a sucker for you I got dreams
Dreams to remember
X3
Oh Gravity
X2
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is Do you ever get the feelin
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That weve been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like weve known ourselves that long
And i can't say i really blame you for being bored with the beginning
Always staring at the score to figure out whos barely winning
But dont you know
There is a reason strong moves slow
And im okay
If youre okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line
We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
And if you want to know the moment
I knew that i was still alone
I found i never learned your number
I only stored it in my phone
Youd think by now
Id know the shape of calling home
And im okay
If youre okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line
We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
Were both alone
We are tracing
We are tracing
Did you ever get the feeling
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That weve been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like weve knew ourselves that long When I'm standing in the sun
I never really stop to think and miss someone
But when I lose that light
Blue skies at night

When those evening stars shine down
I suddenly remember that you're not around
And I face that fight
Blue skies at night

These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
So tired of all these broken dreams
I'm better on my own it seems

Dog in a ball at the end of my bed
Yet, I wish it was the three of us in yours instead
But I do what's right
Blue skies at night

These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
Who's crying all these winter tears?
They're hanging like this chandelier

And there beside the morning grave
A stronger man in place of where a fool once laid
But for one more day
Blue skies
So come what may
Blue skies
I'll find my way
Blue skies at night This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be a-okay
All my bills have all gone pink
I shit the bed
I broke the bed
This coulda been a slow song
A laundry list of all the wrongs
But end of the day
This is my beautiful disaster-piece I've made
And it goes and I quote ""it will never be like this""
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
I don't understand the numbers
But my faith is in the math
That the odds are all this pain will leave and I will live and
And we'll look back and laugh
And to all the hearts I've broken
And the ones that once broke mine
I've got suspicions, all will be forgiven in time
All you gotta do is call them up and say that now
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
And if it ever gets bad
I mean really bad
I'll move to Nova Scotia
Forget the life I had
I'll be up at 9 each morning
Down by the shore
Collecting things that fell off boats in storms
Well ok so I might never
But it's nice to know the option's there
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
A reason for the rain (x3)
And it doesn't help
That I keep biting my lip in the same place I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
But then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know that the heart of my life is good
Of your life is good

We're in repair
We're not together but we're getting there And these days
And these days
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
If only my...

I've these dreams of
Walking home
Home where it used to be
Everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, six feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bittersweet feeling hearing No Such Thing on the radio

And these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they were at the start of me
Had it made in '83

Thinking 'bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother John
But on an 18-month delay
He's a-okay, by the way
Here I stand, six feet small
And smiling cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actors' names have changed
Oh well

Well, these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
I wish things would be more like they were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
Plot a course to the source of the purest little part of me

And most my memories
Have escaped me or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of Bridgeport, CT, and 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards, replace the shutters
But that's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my, whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father says, What you gonna do with your life?
Oh Daddy dear, you know, you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have, oh no, no, no, no
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, girls, let's hear it for the boys
Let's hear it for my baby
Let's hear it for the boys
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Oh, oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving, one-man show
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If my life was more like '83 I saw you sleeping on the couch tonight
You know it serves you right
Makes you luckier than i
All the colors in the room have changed
Appear to disagree
But brother ive discovered you
We're pushin on
We're passin through
And it won't be long
Till i walk with you
But tonight im down
But im inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
But isn't it a shame
The times have changed
But isnt it strange
Lifelines stay the same
The same
We're never where we wanna be
That's ok with me
It's just the way it is it seems
It feels like make believe
But you're my history
But brother i've rediscovered you and
We're pushing on
We're passing through
And it won't be long
Till i walk with you
But tonight im down
Im inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
But isnt it a shame
The times have changed
But isnt it strange
Lifelines stay the same
Round and round
Can't believe my heart has waited this long
All along
We've been children in a cold world where
Wonder was lost every day
And if love was a compass
Oh i have lost my way If melody is my destiny
Then what's left of me
I'll give to you
If next to me
Is all that you need to be
Would you settle for fantasy
If it's the best you could do
Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to
Would the world between us
Break these ties
We've work so hard to realize
Can postcard say
What I see in your eyes
Could I ever break away
Would I be satisfied
And find peace inside
Rolling half my life
Over broken white lines
Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to
Will I wake up one morning
And see your face
And streaks on the window
That the rainstorm makes
Could you bear all the weight
And the strength that it takes
Could I ever break away
Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to
Would the world between us
Break these ties
We've worked so hard to realize
Can a postcard say
What I see in your eyes
Could I ever break away Buzzing just like neon
Buzzing just like neon I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't know what it's like to land and not race to your door
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key in your bedroom neighborhood
Me sleep-walking in Hollywood
I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me â€~I love you, take a right'
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight
I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you
I'm gonna steer clear, oh yeah
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
See you there
I think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay in the gray
I think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay, gonna stay
And all the streetlights say nevermind, nevermind
And the canyon lines say nevermind
And sunset says we see this all the time, nevermind, never you mind
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch your life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you
But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh but I
Need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, and that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Yes I've gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Because I got to have faith
Oh yeah, faith
Got to have faith
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith I met a man I didn't know that asked me how are you doing
Should have just said fine cause it's all he wanted to hear
But for reasons unknown in a sorrowful tone I said
Man it's been a hell of a year
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around

And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
If life's shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds

I went to go see some gypsy to tell me my future
But she asked for my photograph instead
As I walked through the cold with my fortune untold I said
Good luck trying to reach me when I'm dead


I saw the love I used to know swallow me whole
On a day I was out of clean clothes
She sized me up and she said honey how is your head
I said you can't call me honey but honey heaven only knows


Bet your going to be finding a break in the clouds
No, no, no I don't know where I'm going
And I might might might just be hanging around
And if life shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds Just cast away
And I am lost at sea
Another lonely day
And no one here but me
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me
Before I fall into despair

I send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle

A year has passed since
I wrote my note
I should have known it
Right from the start
Only hope can
Keep me together
Love can mend your life but
Love can break your heart


Walked out this morning
I don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles
Washed up on the shore
It seems I'm not alone at
Being alone
A hundred million castaways
All looking for a home I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh
I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh
Your cat likes me more
Why didn't you think of this first?
Now your cat wishes that he was mine
(I pet your cat a new way)
I pet your dog a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
I pet your dog a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
Cuz when I lay this way
He really wants me to stay
I pet your dog a new way
I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
See he's my best friend now
I bet you're wondering how
I pet your cat a new way I was cleaning up
Putting stuff away
When I found it there yesterday
It was late you were drinking
The picture was dark and we both were blinking
I want you back today
I thought you left your toothbrush here
As a way to say Ill always be messing with you
I just remembered that time at the market
You snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave
I can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve
Say ""she's gonna be good for you""
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
So they say
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you want you want you back want you want you back ""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change


We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
See the little faggot with the earring and the make-up
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's millionaire
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
I shoulda' learned to play the guitar
I shoulda' learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that ? Hawaiian noises ?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free
We gotta install ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's, Lord
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' get your chicks for free
Money for nothin' get chicks for free Some of us
We're hardly ever here
The rest of us were born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from going under?
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're trying to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
Wheels up
I've got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me Is there anyone who
Ever remembers changing their mind from
The paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls
Ever breaking rank at all
For something someone yelled real loud one time
Everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Everyone believes
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching under water
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon
For the war that's raging on inside
Everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Everyone believes
And no one's going quietly
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can
Belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can
Belief can I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind it screams mary
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broke pieces of yesterdays life
Says Somewhere a queen is weeping
And Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it whispers Mary
The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags on down the stream
'cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind it screams Mary
And the wind it cries Mary
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this won't be the last""
And the wind cries Mary
And the wind cries Mary I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on you and me
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna give up on love
Every beat of my heart baby,pounds with joy but not in vain
Every beat of my heart baby,pounds with joy but not in vain
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna
I ain't gonna give up on love
Little Johnny Taylor told us all, oh so long ago
What about the midnight cryin'....Woah that cheatin' and lyin'
What about the price that will....Oh surely be paid
Oh when we gave up on love....Love will surely have it's day
If we all just give up on love, yeah
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna,Love ain't gonna,Love ain't gonna
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up, I ain't gonna give up,I ain't gonna,I ain't gonna,I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna give up on love
Everytime I try a little good love, good love, good love
Good love just won't let me be
THIS WAS WRITTEN BY STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say ""Beware doll, you're
Bound to fall"";
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't walk so proud
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your
Next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
You've gone to the finest school all right
Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced
In it
And nobody has ever taught you how to
Live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have
To get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery trend, but now you
Realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks
For you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on chrome horse with
Your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could
Steal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty
People
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it
Made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and
Things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that
He used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't
Refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to
Lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to
Conceal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone? Well Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find
There's only one man in this world who gets to
Sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world who gets to
Sleep with her by his side
I'm thinking something like Olivia could
Keep me through the night
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
No, I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say I'd let her in
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something

You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying to keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying

I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)

Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet)

They eat off of you (They eat off of you)
You're a vegetable

Billie Jean
Is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, spying
Saying you just want to be starting something

I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)

If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
You'll be always trying to stop that child from cryin'
Hustling, stealing, lying, now baby's slowly dyin'

You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
I know I am someone, and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

Help me sing it
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Help me sing it babe
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Sing it to the world, sing it out loud
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa I'm a lazy lover
Undercover
Wasting time
Then one day this summer
I changed my number
To cut my line
Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know, I'll be OK
Good love is on the way
3 years broken-hearted
But now her ghost is finally gone
I'm done with broken people
This is me
I'm working on (because I know)

Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm
Down by the door
You can take all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
And I tried to call-been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Taking my own advice
I'm giving up tonight good luck to you
And the king
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free if you wanted me
When! When you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know life as the man
Livin' life as the man on the side Violent skies
10 am
Falling on my knees again
Outside in the underground
Proud in the rain
I'm walking a straight line
Stepped on all of the cracks this time
I don't care I'm not moving aside
For anyone
Outside in the underground
Proud in the rain
Outside in the underground
There's no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home
But I've stopped searching
Cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh I've got a hundred lives
Oh I've got to get it right
Oh who knows someday I might
Outside in the underground
Underground
Proud in the rain
Outside in the underground
There's no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home but I stopped searching
Cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh I've got a hundred lives
Oh I got to get it right
Oh who knows someday I might
Oh I've got to get it right (Spoken)
Matt Mangano:I like to eat an orange with George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
So juicy sweet
So good to eat
An orange with George Malacorange
Oooooooooo
Bop ba ba
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
So juicy sweet
So good to eat
An orange with George Malacorange
George is my friend Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
And now I'm walking in the park
And all of the birds, they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unready
Oh, yeah, I'm never really ready
Oh, I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there Goodbye cold
Goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow
And goodbye shame
I'm headin' out west with my headphones on
Boarding a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows
I just found out her ghost left town
The Queen of California is a-steppin' down
Hello beauty
Hello strange
Hello wonder
What's your name
Looking for the sun that Neil Young hung
After the gold rush of 1971
I just found out her ghost left town
The Queen of California is a-steppin' down
If you see her
Say hello
Just don't tell me
I told you so
Joni wrote 'Blue' in a house by the sea
I gotta believe there's another color waiting for me
To set me free
I just found out her ghost left town
The Queen of California is a-steppin' down, down, down
Get down Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh honey that I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', This ain't livin' Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
But mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway
The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
You were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes
Saying, ""if my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now""
'cause everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
Why
I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How
I don't know how
I don't know how but I just sit back and I see my way right through it
When the memories are ten feet tall
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Days are long and words are cruel
They won't get the best of you
'cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me Publishers: ©REACH MUSIC PUBLISHING

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late
Over you
I'm never over, over you
There's something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me
Yeah, I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette
Yeah, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do
Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah
Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be Bought a ticket for a trip I wanted long ago
Staring deep into crying eyes
Said goodbye, stood in line, now I changed my mind
I used to run and never look behind

But now, now I've got a love to leave
And now, not gonna walk away so easily

I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane

Plane lands short a man on the other side
Driver stands with a sign in faith
Checks his watch as he size up the time gone by
Two lonely pieces circle baggage claim

But yeah, now I've got a love to leave
And yeah, don't you know it changes
Everything, everything

I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane

No, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't

I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now
I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, ""Well anyway""
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said, ""Think before speaking""
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said, ""Think before speaking""
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked
I just wanna be funny
Looks like the jokes on me
So call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls
Take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories tiny tragedies
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for 'Cause it's summer time baby!
And I take myself seriously in the fall
Oh yeah!
Uh-huh!

Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
A Model citizen with zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the movin' parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
(Uh-oh!)
Panama
Panama (ow!)
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Woo!

Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off
(You know what I'm sayin')
Ah, reach down between my legs and...ease the seat back
She's runnin', I'm flyin'
Right behind in the rearview mirror now
Got the fearin', power steerin'
Pistons poppin', ain't no stoppin' now

Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Panama! I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed

The rats and children
Follow me out of town
The rats and children
Follow me out of their homes
Come on kids Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you're right?
Some people been known to do it all their lives
But you find yourself alone just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces on the hotel floor
Hard times have helped me see
I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Well I ain't no troublemaker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn't mean I didn't make it hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love that I can finally feel
Hard times, let me be
I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare Don't know why Tori came by
I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori'd been driving around the town for awhile
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why Tori just smiled
Mentioned something 'bout how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding
She said, ""I might not be seeing him soon
I got a few things I've been waiting to do""
Hey, Tori came by, Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by, she says to say goodbye
Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the backseat inside
Sure it's so, she can't look out behind at the road
She said, ""I might not be seein him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do""
Hey, Tori came by, Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by, she says to say goodbye
Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure that she's fine Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66 I know you've been sworn
I read your complaint
You're needing someone older
And though I've been warned to live day by day
There's something taking over
Did you expect to kiss me one time
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again?
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
Your mother complains that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short, a minute early
But I am your man
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
Im calling it love soon
Im calling it love soon
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest storyline
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
C'mon back to bed
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
98 and 6 degrees of separation from you, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love CashMoneyAP
Oh man it's the chronic don't even worry bout it
CashAP got the beat tied

I've been getting money like Monopoly
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
You know that I got control and every part is quality
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
I've been getting money like Monopoly
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
You know that I got control and every part is quality
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere

In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love why don't you say so?
If you want more love why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love why don't you say so?
If you want more love why don't you say so?
Just say so...
How come the only way to know how high you get me is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me but I can't break through it all

SONGWRITERS
MAYER, JOHN ""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
""Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white""
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible as long as I'm alive
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you I tried to call
Been busy all night gave up waiting at daylight
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
One of the many
But one of the few
To stand back and wait for you
Excuse me, Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me
Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playing the part of the queen
Taking my own advice, I'm giving up tonight
Good luck to you and the king
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil in?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man you know life as the man
Living life as the man on the side When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hand
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Oh  about that
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns
No, no, no, no, no
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh honey that I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', This ain't livin' River's strong you can't
Swim inside it we could
String some lights up the, hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could
You could drive with your headlights out
'Cause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Don't get up just to, get another you can
Drink from mine, we can't, leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you want to get older with me
'Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
I got a rock from the river in my medicine bag
Magpie feather in his medicine bag
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire Now the cover of Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Ain't supposed to make me feel alone
What a drag to know
I'll have to learn to let it go
Show me something I can be
And play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
And they're celebrating broken things
I don't want a world of broken things
You can tell that something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white
What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday
Show me something I can be
And play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it
Just show me something I can be
Play a song that we can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me Eat one and throw the rest away
Eat one and throw the rest away
When you live alone at Christmas-time
Your diet’s turnin’ on a dime
Eat one and throw the rest away
Eat one more then throw the rest away
Just eat one more then throw the rest away
(Come on)
Just eat one more, it couldn’t hurt
Tonight my dinner is dessert
Eat one more then throw the rest away
Rapidly eat as many as you can before you throw the rest away
Rapidly early as many as you can before you throw the rest away
Cause you don’t want to be fat for New Year’s
You just want to stand here above the garbage
And eat all of the ????? Away
Go back into the garbage for some you threw away
Go back into the garbage for some you threw away
Tonight you know your diet’s wrecked
And you have got no self-respect
Go back into the garbage and (uhh uhh uhhhh)

No, you’re an adult, you can live with snacks
You might as well just try and put these back"
Jack Johnson,"Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain’t no need to go outside

But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe
Laka ukulele
Mama made a baby
I really don’t mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just raining
There ain’t no need to go outside

Ain’t no need, ain’t no need
Mm-mmm-mm-mmm
Can't you see, can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind

But the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy when
The whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow
Mh-mmm
Wake up slow

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see
We've got to wake up slow There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is
Not enough time
And there is no...
No song I could sing
And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing
We're better together Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say I can't do everything?
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning

And there's no time to waste
Will it all keep spinning, spinning round and round and
Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found?
I don't want this feeling to go away

Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Is this how it's supposed to be?
Is this how it's supposed to be? I know she said it's alright
But you can make it up next time
I know she knows it's not right
There ain't no use in lying
Maybe she thinks I know something
Maybe maybe she thinks it's fine
Maybe she knows something I don't
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down

I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
And I know that when she said she's going to try
Well it might not work because of other ties and
I know she usually has some other ties
And I wouldn't want to break them, no, I wouldn't want to break them
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Until then, well, I'm going to have to lie too

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go

The harder that you try baby, the further you'll fall
Even with all the money in the whole wide world
Please please please don't pass me
Please please please don't pass me
Please please please don't pass me by
Everything you know about me now baby, you're going to have to change
You're going to have to call it by a brand new name
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag me down
And just like a tree down by the water baby I shall not move
Even after all the silly things you do
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag me down Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't  the lord no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you
Ah maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long
But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love
Ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
Fool, hm hm Well, I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
Watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance
The cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

And all the real estate in my mind is for sale
It's all been subdivided
Divided into reasons why
My two opposing thoughts at once are fine
The residue from the price tag
On the tip of my tongue
The words don't come they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth
And the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about reality's
A slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

Now I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard we need more space
I heard that six or seven words are in bad taste
It's absurd to believe that we might
Deserve anything
As if its balanced in the end
And the good guys always win

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite
With the residue from the price tag
On those two opposing thoughts in my mind
Us against them fearful kind of walls Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
It was some time in early September
Though you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind
So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon
Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's Rewind
Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are
We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at
Well all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember? I know I've seen your face somewhere
Selling something, some big idea
I know I've seen that vacant stare
Selling sunsets for somebody else

You find yourself asking yourself
What is any of it worth
You find yourself looking up at night
From the bottom of the earth

And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more than this?

The taste of trouble on your lips
'Cause now they're biting at your thoughts
You tell yourself just to turn away
But you know you've already lost

The smell of rain when it’s on a wind
Will never be paid in full
You try in vain to account for this mess
And everything that you stole

Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? (Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? (Ooo)
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more than this?

'Cause now they're biting at your feet
They got you running from this place
Now they're breathing down your neck
Your eyes look lonely in your face

I see you looking just out of frame
What is it pulling you there?
'Cause things can never stay the same
So what is keeping you here?

Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? (Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? (Ooo)
They grow out their teeth
They need a little something now
Every time you think, well, they’d be biting at your thoughts
And every time you blink, well, you'll be so damn far
But you want more than this
I know I've seen your face somewhere I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
She wears a smile that can make me want to sing
She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
She could make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You've got to be careful when you've got good love
Because the angels will just keep on multiplying
But you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile can change all of mine

We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Mmmmm.. I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
There's food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
Into my attic, whistling static when the young learn to fly
I will patch all the holes up again
Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I keep food in my belly
And hope that my time isn't soon, isn't soon
And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We went walking so far that it grew back again
And there's no trail at all only grass growing taller
Get out my machete battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose because I'll be down if time don't win
I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
Own family trees teach them, thank you and please
They spread their own roots, then watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins
And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
I said, Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
Walking as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now so for now I
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
Well this engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Because it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get
To where I don't need to be so I
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I want to break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down
But you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
You don't know nothing but you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing if you don't let go
The things that you find and you lose and you know
You keep on rolling, put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright, so put the blinds down low
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I want to break on down
But I can't stop now It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could

I remember when you and me, mmm, how we used to be just good friends
Wouldn't give me none
But all I wanted was some
She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one
That can justify leaving
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
Man he got too much time to waste
His dreams are like commercials
But her dreams are picture perfect and
Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da

Well I was eating lunch at the D. L. G
When this little girl came and she sat next to me
I've never seen nobody move the way she did
Well she did and she does and she'll do it again
When you move like a jellyfish
Rhythm doesn't mean nothing
You go with the flow
You don't stop
Move like a jellyfish
Rhythm is nothing
You go with the flow
You don't stop

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could

If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me
If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could Oh you win, it's your show now
So what's it going to be?
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch oh ?
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad, getting worse so...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused, got too much to lose
Give me some truth now, whose side are we on
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob-tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way now...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all going to be
You might notice some hesitation
Because it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your whole reason
You let's beginning the show
And all I really want to know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

(Where'd all the good people go?)
They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused give me some truth
You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on today, anyway
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Okay, whatever you say
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone I heard this old story before
Where the people keep on killing for their metaphors
But don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it just isn't so easy like that
So I turn the page
And read the story again
And again and again
It sure seems the same
With a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing, always guessing
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments,
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're trying
But where is this all leading?
We'll never know
It all happened so much
Faster than you can say disaster
Want to take a time-lapse
And look at it backwards find the last word
And maybe that's just the answer
That we're afterBut after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot just
One breath in a chain of thought
We're moments just combusting
We feel certain but we'll never never know
It sure seems the same
Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping
Rebuilding never growing
Never know
If you never know
Never know
Never know
Knock knock, coming door to door
To tell you that their metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
And things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what they're spoon-feeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again and again and again
It sure seems the same
So many different names
Our hearts are strong, our heads are weak
We'll always be competing never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing, confusing
But the true things
All we got is questions
We'll never know
Never know
Never know
Never know... They say Taylor was a good girl
Never one to be late
Complain express ideas in her brain
Working on the night shift
Passing out the tickets
You're going to have to pay her
If you want to park here
Well mommy's little dancer has
Quite a little secret
Working on the streets now
Never going to keep it
It's quite an imposition
And now she's only wishing
That she would have listened
To the words they said
Poor Taylor

Well she just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds, yeah
And she'll pretend that
She's somewhere else
So far and clear
About 2,000 miles from here

Well Peter Patrick pitter patters on the window
And Sunny Silhouette won't let him in
And poor old Pete's got nothing because he's been falling
But somehow Sunny knows just where he's been
He thinks that singing on a Sunday's going to save his soul
But now that Saturday's gone
Well sometimes he thinks that he's on his way
But I can see, that his brake lights are on

And he just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds, yeah
And he'll pretend that
Well he's somewhere else
So far and clear
About 2,000 miles from here

She's such a tough enchilada
Filled up with nada
Giving what you going to give to get a dollar bill
She used to be a limber chick
Time's been ticking
Now she's finger licking to the man
With the money in his pocket
Flying in his rocket
Only stopping by on his way to a better world

If Taylor finds a better world
Then Taylor's going to run away Oi lienda
Bella che fa?
Bonita, bonita que tal?
But belle
Je ne comprend pas français
So you'll have to speak to me
Some other way When you were a little girl
And you were an ocean away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already listening to The Pixies

We were a little shy
When you were still an arm's length away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already reading beat poetry

We were a little free
When we were seven seas away from anything
Finally knew what I wanted then
But you were already my best friend
You had already become my best friend

When you were teaching geometry
We were both living off of your salary
I want to thank you for not kicking me out
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house

Finally we made a family
Make a little home then fill it up with children
Never mind the rest it's all just
Irrelevant if we're just stardust
This dusty old world won't rest and
These dusty little kids keep stretching high
Just like the tide

When you were a little middle-aged like me
And we were already 15 love songs deep
You give me too much love, so I blame you
Well, here's another love song for you
You give me too much love, what can I do?
Well, here's another love song for you
Just another love song for you When your mind is a mess so is mine I can't sleep
Because it hurts when I think my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make the chances we take
They're not yours they're not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we said and the words that we mean
Words can fall short, can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake
Now please close your eyes
Woman, please get some sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
We told each other there is no other way
Too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came well it's leaving
It's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we would find, our minds would be free
To go to sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we told each other there is no other way Trouble travels fast
When you're specially designed for crash testing
Or wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Come on and tell us what you're trying to prove
Because it's a battle when you dabble in war
You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
Whether the storm drain running rampant just stamp it
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care
Just cash in your blanks for little toy Tanks
Learn how to use them
Then abuse them and choose them over conversations
Relationships are overrated
""I hated everyone"" said the sun
And so I will cook all your books
You're too good looking and mistaken
You could watch it instead
From the comfort of your burning beds
Or you can sleep through the static

Who needs sleep when we've got love?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
We went beyond where we should have gone

Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
The feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came
Shock and awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brute force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do
We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of god wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a dodge
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy
Well, mighty, mighty appetite
We just eat them up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you It's really too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look
He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Well I guess you could say
That he don't even know where to begin
'Cause he looked both ways but he was so afraid
Digging deep into the ditch, every chance he missed
And the mess he made
'Cause hate is such a strong word
And every brick he laid, a mistake they say
That his walls are getting taller, and his world is getting smaller
Better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
It's really too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look
He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
If the weather gets better we should get together
Spend a little time or we could do whatever
And if we get together we'd be twice as clever
So staple it together and call it bad weather
Mh mh After all this time
After all of these seasons
After your own decision to go to the water for a reason
It's only the ocean and you
And all of these lines
Will all be erased soon
They go out with the tide
And come back with the waves so
It's only the ocean and you

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love oh, but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in

When this work is done
And this coat is dry
When this world's too much
It will be
Only the ocean and me
When these sails go up
Mountains fade away
Stars come out
I'm finally free
It's only the ocean and me

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love oh, but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in
And you pull me in
You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love oh, but you don't hate
You just roll right over me
And you pull me in
And you pull me in

You just roll over me
And you pull me in Look at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm just like those
And what about your soul? Is it cold?
Is it straight from the mold, and ready to be sold?
And cars and phones and diamond rings
Bling, bling, because those are only removable things
And what about your mind? Does it shine?
Are there things that concern you, more than your time?

Gone, going, gone
Everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, when they don’t wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone

Look at you, out to make a deal
You try to be appealing, but you lose your peel
And what about those shoes you’re in today?
They’ll do no good, on the bridges you burnt along the way
Are you willing to sell anything?
Gone, with your herd
Leave your footprints
And we’ll shame them with our words
Gone, people, all careless and consumed, gone

Gone, going, gone
Everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, if they don’t wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone A brand new baby was born yesterday, just in time
Papa cried, baby cried, said your tears are like mine
I heard some words from a friend on the phone
Didn't sound so good
The doctors gave him two weeks to live
I'd give him more if I could
You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could
Down the middle drops one more grain of sand
They say that new life makes losing life easier to understand
Words are kind they help ease the mind
I'll miss my old friend
And though you've got to go we'll keep a piece of your soul
One goes out, one comes in
You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We can rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
We safely walk to school without a sound
Well, here we are no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
Play time, we will throw the ball
Then back to school class the hall
The teacher marks our height against the wall
The teacher marks our height against the wall
And we don't notice any time pass
Because we don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
The teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes it when you sing
Tonight I'll dream while in my bed
While silly thoughts run through my head
Of the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
You and I will walk together again

'Cause I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends In my rear view
I watch you watching the twilight
Behind the telephone lines
Nothing to prove, or to assume
Just thinking that your thoughts are different than mine
In my rear view
I watch you
I give you your life, would you give me mine?
I see you slowly swim away
Because the light is leaving town
To a place that I can't be
There's no apologies

Just go on
Just go on
There are still so many things
I want to to say to you

But go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood that's moving
The moment that we start
The moment that we start

I see perfect little eyes
Watch the shadows of the clouds
And the surface of the ocean out the window of a plane
I get nervous when I fly
I'm used to walking with my feet
Turbulence is like a sigh that I can't help but over think
What is the purpose of my life
If it doesn't ever do
With learning to let it go
Live vicariously through you
You can do the same
It's the least you can do
Because it's a lonely little chain
If you don't add to it Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame everyone
You broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard
Oh, and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard?

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How are you going to scratch any backs?
Better hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

Hope the tide will take our lines and
Hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines away The light was leaving in the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to Papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations
The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough, all else fades
Fades away
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations All at once
The world can overwhelm me
There's almost nothing that you could tell me
That could ease my mind
Which way will you run
When it's always all around you
And the feeling lost and found you again
A feeling that we have no control
Around the sun
Some say
There's going to be the new hell
Some say
It's still too early to tell
Some say
It really is no myth at all
Keep asking ourselves are we really
Strong enough
There's so many things that we got
Too proud of
We're too proud of
We're too proud of
I want to take the pre-conceived
Out from underneath your feet
We could shake it off
Instead we'll plant some seeds
We'll watch them as they grow
And with each new beat
From your heart the roots grow deeper
The branches will they reach for what
Nobody really knows
But underneath it all
There's this heart all alone

What about when it's gone
And it really won't be so long
Sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singing from at all

There's a world we've never seen
There's still hope between the dreams
The weight of it all
Could blow away with a breeze
If you're waiting on the wind
Don't forget to breathe
Cause as the darkness gets deeper
We'll be sinking as we reach for love
At least something we could hold
But I'll reach to you from where time just can't go You know I love my Lady, been together so long
Like a worn-out recording, of my favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns, there was this letter that read:
""If you like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""
-Instrumental-
I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad
""Yes, I like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, but I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called Scrappy Malloy's, we'll plan our escape.""
-Instrumental-
So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew,""
""I never knew you liked Piña Coladas, or getting caught in the rain and the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
You're the lady that I've looked for, come with me and escape""
-Instrumental- Your shadow walks faster than you
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to it
It's going to get that the best of you
It's going to lift you up and let you down
Mmm-mmm-mmm

It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that
You learn to love

Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus
But in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
A ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so
Hope you're not alone

Your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can quite get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth to it
It's fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too

Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you and then teach you to get back up Understand one thing
If and when you drink from this vast ocean
You can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it

Mom forget to tuck you in
Make you begin a war within your head
One that you could never win
Send in the troops and insecurities
What doesn't matter in the end
So daddy told you hold your chin up son

Understand one thing
If and when you drink from this vast ocean
You can't control it
Na, na, na, you can't control it


With the procession underway
Understand the magnitude of the melodies that they make
Did it fill your lungs with rage?
What's the matter, did catastrophe get your tongue tied in the fray?
When the band began to play
Daddy wiped the tears away, he said son

Please understand one thing
If and when you drink from this vast ocean
You can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it Well, how many subplots you got runnin' around your mind?
The gordian knot must be cut through
Well, give me a red pen
I will simplify your story
Which part of yourself can you afford to lose?
If you show me your list, then I will show you mine
Let's kill off a character or two
All the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
Is gonna rise and shine
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
It don't shine for you
Like the joy and the tear in your eye
Like the little star that could
Could you remember every mistake that you made?
At least all the ones you should? (Have made)
If you make it your wish, then I will make it mine
Try to make sense of who is who
All the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
Is gonna rise and shine
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
Still gonna shine on this world
Past it too
It won't stop
It don't shi-ine just for you
Birds don't sing
Trees don't lose
Leaves don't change
Fa-all just for you
Shi-ine just for you
Shi-ine just for you
Shi-ine just for you
And how many subplots you got swimmin' through that mind?
Scream for sympathy or sing the blues
Run from the shadows or relax in the shade
Which road you gonna choose?
We've all got places to be; we've all got things to do
We've all got this moment it's ours to lose
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
(Summer don't turn to fall)
And all the light under the sun
(It's not just for you)
And all the light above it, too
(Summer don't turn to fall)
And all the light under the sun
(It's not just for you)
And all the light above it, too
(Summer don't turn to fall)
And all the light under the sun
(It's not just for you)
And all the light above it, too
Still gonna shine Hey, little girl
You might not know this song
This is not the kind of song that you can sing along to but
Hey, little girl
Maybe someday
At least that's what all the good people will say

Hey, little girl
Look what you've done
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own

Hey, little girl
Black and white and right and wrong
Only live inside a song, I will sing to you
You don't ever have to feel lonely
You will never lose any tears
You don't have to feel any sadness
When you look back on the years
How can I look you in the eyes
And tell you such big lies?
The best I can do is try to show you
How to love with no fear

My little girl
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that
You looked good
As I walked away
If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry
But you never really be
The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out


Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
Building with bent nails we're
Falling but holding, I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

Always looking
Always looking
Always looking
Always looking out It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now
By now we should know how to communicate
Instead of coming to blows, We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all
Burning under the same sun?
Buy now and save, it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could close our eyes its still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all
Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we're gonna blame now in all?
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shame
By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?
It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out?
Of sight, out of mind
And who we're gonna blame all in all?
It's just a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shame With everything ahead of us
We left everything behind
But nothing that we needed
At least not at this time
And now the feeling that I'm feeling
Well it's feeling like my life is finally mine
With nothing to go back to we just continue to drive

Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

I didn't know what I was looking for
So I didn't know what I'd find
I didn't know what I was missing
I guess you've been just a little too kind
And if I find just what I need
I'll put a little peace in my mind
Maybe you've been looking too
Or maybe you don't even need to try

Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

With everything in the past
Fading faster and faster until it was gone
Found out I was losing so much more than I knew all along
Because everything I've been working for
Was only worth nickels and dimes

But if I had a minute for every hour that I've wasted
I'd be rich in time, I'd be doing fine

Cause without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side There's traffic in the sky
And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawing waves on the pavement
Shadows of the planes on the pavement

Its enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe its a dream and if I scream
It will burst at the seams
Whole place will fall to pieces
And then they'd say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well

Puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be digging
Instead they're looking up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens
The shadows on the way to the heavens

Its enough to make me cry
That don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found
We can learn from diggin' down
But no one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well

Words of wisdom all around
But no one ever seems to listen
They're talking about their plans on the paper
Building up from the pavement
The shadows from the scrapers on the pavement

Its enough to make me sigh
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The words are all around
But the words are only sounds
And no one ever seems to listen
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well
Lost in the well So much love
The kids are laughing in their sleep
Swimming through their dreams into the morning
So peaceful all the stories that we're told
Lead them through the night back from the shadows
So much joy every little girl and boy
Even better when they wake up tomorrow
So much love
In their little mistletee
Going to miss you until we meet again in the morning
So much peace in their pitter-patter feet
Any open eyes can see that minds are reaching
So much joy
I'm afraid to be swept away
Upstream there's a spring that brings in the new day
These are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need
And your crazy curly morning hair
Your maka piapia stare
Smiling down from the top of the stairs
You're so sweet
And your robot pictures spread around
I swear your feet don't touch the ground
Once it starts it don't slow down
But I don't want it to

And these are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need In the morning when the world came awake
Before you knew me I knew your name
It was painted across the day as it breaks
An impression in your window frame

When you saw me out your window
Singing from the garden
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes
Singing from the bottom

But one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
Because I need you to want me the same

When you saw me washing dishes
Singing from the bottom
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been in the ashes
Singing from the garden

Where everything reaches for the sun
Still unsure of what we'll become
But I need you to reach out to me
See in me more than I could see
Because I'm afraid that

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now

Who took the time and where did they take it
I want to take it back
I don't want them to break it
All these plans that we should be making right now
Right now

You see one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
Because I need you to want me the same

When you saw me out your window
Singing from the garden
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes
Singing from the bottom

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now

Who took the time and where did they take it?
I want to take it back
I don't want them to break it
All these plans that we should be making right now Brush-fire fairy-tales
Itsy-bitsy diamond wells
Big fat hurricanes
Yellow-bellied given names
Well shortcuts can slow you down
And in the end we're bound
To rebound off
Well dust off your thinking caps
Solar powered plastic plants
Pretty pictures of things we ate
We are only what we hate
But in the long run we have found
Silent films are full of sound
Inaudibly free

Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that

Inaudible melodies
Serve narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones
Help to notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Frame-lines tell me what to see
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax


Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen Behind the wheel against the road
Next to you is central coast
The central thought within my mind
Is how to stay within these lines, but still be free
Beneith the ground the giants sleep and maybe we're just in their dreams
The setting sun with every turn
Above the ground the oak trees burn
And they wheep, for rain
And for this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars
A pocket knife and no guitar
Coffee cup a deck of cards
To run dashboard feet
Flashlight children by the streem
A box of books
A book of rocks
One for the birds
One for the knots
That I will learn how to tie around this day
From sliding away
From this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars
A little word to keep it perdy
Facinated by it all
The first awake will stoke the coals
The early morning river roads
The last one in the swing will break
Stones will stake the kids will make those lines
Rocks and boxes by the creek
Words are broken smoke signals will leads us into the light
Into it all and
Always endless conversations
Implicated by the stars
A little wood to keep it burning
Facinated by it all I lived awhile without you
Darn near half my life
I no longer see our unborn children
Born to you my unwed wife
But yesterday I had a vision
Beneath the tree where we once talked
Of an old couple burning
Their love letters so their children
Won't be shocked

Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away
All my friends are gettin older
So I guess I must be too
Without their loving kindness
I don't know what I'd do
Oh the wine bottle's half empty-
The money's all spent
And we're a cross between our parents
And hippies in a tent

Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away
In a mucked up lovely river
I cast my little fly
I look at that river and smell it
And it makes me wanna cry
Oh to clean our dirty planet
Now there's a noble wish
And I'm puttin my shoulder to the wheel
Cause I wanna catch some fish

Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Drop the anchor make it stop
Edible digital clocks
Infinity figure eight
Figure out what you're not
Junk-an a po, cut your loss
Come to cut your corners off
You're the rock and I'm the paper
You're the scissors I'm the rock

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Feel this storm go through my sail
Follow someone else's trail
Camera A, Camera B
In your home, on your TV
Hook me up, look in my eyes
Dilate do I surprise you?
Watch me blush, blink sink
Trust in me so you don't have to think

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Can you even feel what's real?
With such a shallow depth of field?
Kill the engine stop the car
Cut the lights and there you are
Stars so small
You're the king of them all
Stand tall, rack focus
Now you crawl back broken
Now the stars so vast
Heat wind storm break my mast

Feel this storm go through my sail
Follow someone else's trail
Can you even feel what's real?
With such a shallow depth of field

Look what the other got Fragments on the sea
Birds of prey above
All that lies beneath
No longer what it was, it changed
Why can't we relate
Shadows from the deep
Your thoughts were afraid of
Secrets that we keep
The surface of our love and hate
Why can't we relate
With ourselves with what we open
Up when it's too late
What we used to be
What we will become
Words we cannot see
Breaking up by one, by one
Slowly we felt under a spell
One by one
Slowly we wake up
Fragments of a scene
From a distance they jumped down
Little time machines
Messages of love and hate
Why can't we relate
With ourselves with what we open
Up when it's too late I want to be where the talk of the town
Is about last night when the sun went down
Yeah, and the trees all dance
And the warm wind blows in that same old sound

And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about

The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm hmm hmm

And the trouble I find is that the trouble finds me
It's a part of my mind, it begins with a dream
And a feeling I get when I look and I see
That this world is a puzzle, I'll find all of the pieces
And put it all together and then I'll rearrange it
I'll follow it forever
Always be as strange as it seems, hmm hmm
Nobody ever told me not to try, not to try
Oh, let's try, oh, let's try

And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about

The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm I sing oooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  oooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh I come over early in the morning
I'm like a heat wave, without warning
And when I touch you my heart begins to flutter
'cause you're smooth and creamy like peanut butter
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down
I'm gonna flood you, like a love river
Awe baby the post man, is about to deliver
Cook you up some dinner, a little pasta
Listen to some music, a little Rasta
I said girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down
(Girl I wanna lay you down)
Aww baby baby
Don't you know I need your love!
So turn out the lights, bring out the candles
Wrap your arms around my love handles
They say the passion may not always endure
But this feeling that I have for you is burning up my world
Girl I wanna lay you down oooohhh
I said girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down Daybreaks, earthquakes, waves come without you
When I see you, in my dreams you
Never speak never do you need to
Understanding under your wing
Under the impression you gave me
Did I take it did it take me
Further in this continuation
Become patient because there are some
Some rules I cannot break
You showed me when you came
If the ghost is supposed to love
And why do I feel pain
Because nothing is for keeps
You just can't hold a cloud
The shape will always change
And one day come back down
Night falls on all of our decisions
All our plans and all ambitions
And this darkness comes to define us
Comes to take us and remind us
Find our way from this side of thinking
Unafriaid and under your wing
Night falls on us either way
Because there are some
Some rules I cannot break
You showed me when you came
The ghost is supposed to love
And why do I feel pain
Because nothing is for keeps
You just can't hold a cloud
The shape will always change
And one day come back down
Cause night falls on us, either way
Night falls on us, either way
Cause there are some
Some rules I cannot break
You told me when you came
The ghost is supposed to love
And why do I feel pain
Because nothing is for keeps
You just can't hold a cloud
The shape will always change
And one day come back down She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm

She knows the world is just her stage
And so she'll never misbehave
She gives thanks for what they gave her
Man, they practically made her
Into a mmm

She's the one that stumbles when she talks about
The seven foreign films that she's checked out
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm

She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm

But she's the one that stumbles when she talks about
So maybe we shouldn't talk about
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm Situation number one
It's the one that's just begun
But evidently it's too late
Situation number two
It's the only chance for you
It's controlled by denizens of hate
Situation number three
It's the one that no one sees
It's all too often dismissed as fate
Situation number four
The one that left you wanting more
It tantalized you with its bait
Ha ha ha Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music

Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing
With the clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, yeah
The Rodeo Clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
The disco ball spinning, all the music and the women and
The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need, is just a little room to breath
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard
Yeah, yeah
The changes occurred
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd
Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods, but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well
You try to live but he's done trying
Not dead but definitely dying
With the rest of the clowns
Yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm
With the rest of the clowns

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music Bring on your hunters
Let them bring their dogs
It's me that you wanted
I've been right here all along
Right here all along
You better bring your buckets
We've got some dreams to drain
I'll be at the bottom
I've been right here waiting so long
Just waiting so long

Dreams to drain
Put them in a cage
Unlock the pain
And I'll be here waiting

You fell asleep with the key
All your walls
Mean nothing to me
I know you'll come back
To set us free

Run, my dear son
Until we get to the trees
And then keep on going all the way
We've got to get right down to the sea
We've got to get to the sea
Oh, my dear son
We've got to get to the sea

But don't you touch the water
Don't you barely breathe
And if you see yourself
Looking back at you
You're going to have to leave
You're going to have to leave
I don't want you to go
But you've got to leave I can't give you everything you want
But I could give you what you thought you need
A map to keep beneath your seat, you'll read to me in time I'll get you there
But fold it up so we don't find our way back soon, nobody knows we're here
We can park the van and walk to town
Find the cheapest bottle of wine that we could find
And talk about the road behind how getting lost is not a waste of time
Le Bois d'Amour will take us home in the moment we will sing as the forest sleeps

Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you

Well, I will make the table into a bed
The candle is burning down it's time to rest
I can't take back things already gone, but I could give you promises for keeps
And I would only take them back if they become your own and you give them to me

And, it's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you

We could make this into anything
We could make this into more than words we speak
This could make us into anything
It could make us grow and become what we'll be

How will we really know?
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
How can we really know?
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
How does it feel?
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
How does it feel?
It's just like it feels
How does it feel? I would turn on the TV but it's so embarrassing
To see all the other people I don't know what they mean
And it was magic at first when they spoke without sound
But now this world is going to hurt you better turn that thing down
Turn it around

""It wasn't me"", says the boy with the gun
""Sure I pulled the trigger but it needed to be done
Because life's been killing me ever since it begun
You can't blame me because I'm too young""

""You can't blame me sure the killer was my son
But I didn't teach him to pull the trigger of the gun
It's the killing on this TV screen
You can't blame me its those images he sees""

Well ""You can't blame me"", says the media man
Well ""I wasn't the one who came up with the plan
I just point my camera at what the people want to see
Man it's a two way mirror and you can't blame me""

""You can't blame me"", says the singer of the song
Or the maker of the movie which he based his life on
""It's only entertainment and as anyone can see
The smoke machines and makeup and you can't fool me""

It was you it was me it was every man
We've all got the blood on our hands
We only receive what we demand
And if we want hell then hell's what we'll have Imagine there's no heaven
Its easy if you try
And no hell, below us
And above us, is only sky

Imagine all the people
Livin for today
You-ou-ou
You may say, that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill
Or die for
No religion too

Imagine all the people
Livin the life for peace
You-ou-ou
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine no posessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You-ou-ou
And you may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one There's a black hole pulling me in
I slowly bend until I see the back of my own sins
I stole my soul from myself now I wonder
Wonder, is there somebody with a perfect plan
That goes boom when it's stamped and we could understand
How the gods of old used to clap their hands to make thunder
So we're clapping and we're laughing like it was so absurd
In the future we'll be laughing at who we were right now
As man plays god with the land that he plunders
To the one unknown no one can know nor see
That's resistant to greed
If we listen to time after time, time can never go under

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
Its way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind
In my mind
In my mind

And so this vine is trying to climb
Through the window into my life
To bring me symmetry
And memories of a back-lit breeze
Back into a dream on the ground
Looking up at the sun coming down
Into a world of boys and girls
Are holding handheld devices
While they're eating and they're sleeping
And they're dreaming of the prices
We'll be paying down the line
When the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine
And all the greatest of the heroes started jumping from the books
They started wearing ones and zeros
Looking more and more like crooks
They stole the sunlight from the future
Took a sip, drained half the glass, and put it back
And a lot of people like to have a feast
Not so many could stomach the killing
Lot of traffic on the streets, so who's really doing all the drilling
Keep on filling what can never be full
My imagination has got a hold on me Well, your mama made you pretty
And your mama made you sweet
Your daddy gave you daydreams
And more cushion in your seat
Your mama gave you those windows
To your beautiful soul
Your daddy got more love for you
Then you could ever know

You remind me of you
Yes you do now
You remind me of you
Yes you do
Ba doo Ba doo Ba doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh…

Well your mama made a promise
That your daddy's going to keep
Forever's how long
Your mama's going to love your
Daddy made you messy
And your mama made you neat
Forever's how long your daddy's going to love your
Mama made a clone
So she won't be alone
When the boys and me are getting
So out of control

You remind me of you
Yes you do now
You remind me of you
Yes you do
Ba doo Ba doo Ba doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh…

When you cry when you cry
Well your mama's going to dry your eyes
And your daddy's surely gonna try
But only mama's gonna dry your eyes
But your daddy's surely gonna try

When you cry when you cry
Well your mama's going to dry your eyes
And your daddy's surely gonna try
But only mama's gonna dry your eyes
But your daddy's surely gonna try Three it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number

Because two times three is six
And three times six is eighteen
And the eighteenth letter in the alphabet is R
We've got three R's we're going to talk about today

We've got to learn to
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

If you're going to the market to buy some juice
You've got to bring your own bags and you learn to reduce your waste
And if your brother or your sister's got some cool clothes
You could try them on before you buy some more of those
Reuse, we've got to learn to reuse
And if the first two R's don't work out
And if you've got to make some trash
Don't throw it out
Recycle, we've got to learn to recycle

We've got to learn to
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Three it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number

3, 3, 3
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36
33, 30, 27, 24, 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, and
3, it's a magic number Don't worry
Everybody in the room notices you
Sit back and relax
The night is early
You're about to overdo it
So come and tell me something that you've already told me
Because everybody's heard all of your stories
I hope that some of them are true
I've been losing lots of keys lately
I don't know what that means
But maybe I'd be better off with things that can't be locked at all
I've been feeling kind of sea sick lately
See you reaching to me going to save me
You or me, I would much rather take the fall

The world has its ways
To quiet us down
The world has its ways
To quiet us down comes the rain

Down comes our spirits again
But Down comes the strength
To lift us up and then

Been going up when now
For too long
Forget how
To let go
Seems too hard
Too late now
To turn around

The world has its ways
To quiet us down
The world has its ways
To quiet us down comes the rain

Down goes our spirits again
But Down comes the strength
To lift us up and then Is one moon enough
If I can see
With my cheap telescope?
Bet my neighbor has two or three
Down soon enough
What does it mean
If every time I look up
I see them
Laughing down on me?

Take that moon or break across the sea
Everything I want's just out of reach

Is one moon enough
Well, it used to be
When I could see with my own naked eye
She was smiling down on me
Is one ever enough?
How could it ever be if my neighbor has more than me
And my moon
Just out of reach

Take that moon or break across the sea
Everything I want is further from me
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Moon down soon enough
Now I can see a million moons that think of
Me and my moons
Always following me

Take that moon or break across the sea
Everything I want is just out of reach (hmm, hmm)
Why's that moon always following me? (hmm, hmm)
Everything I want's just out of reach (hmm, hmm)
Hmm, hmm, hmm In times like these
In times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mhmm, mhm, mhmm

And there's always been laugh and cry and birth and die
And boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
And heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
But then hurt at times

In times like these
In times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes

And there will always be stop and go and fast and slow
Action,Reaction, sticks and stones and broken bones
Those for peace and those for war
And God bless these ones, not those ones
But these ones make

Times like these
And times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mhmm, mhm, mhmm

But somehow I know it won't be the same
Yeah, somehow I know it'll never be the same I feel sorrow for the fear
And everything it brings
Wonder if it will ever sleep
I know you understand
Because you briefly look away
Focusing on nothing
So now everything is clear
Because there's no one to blame
You got no place to hide
It's only in your mind
And I saw you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You told me time never waits
What is that supposed to mean?

All of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
And take them from our eyes
And make them into monsoons

And turn them into mon-sooner or later
They'll weave their way back to the sea
Going to finally be free
Yeah, free for a while
Until they break
Like waves of sorrow
Always do, all into time
Because time never waits

Daddy don't day dream again
Just help me to believe and then
Show me that there's more than the meantime
Sonny, do you hear the sound?
You will feel it when it breaks
You will know it when its gone
How else can I explain?
Because it's only the pain
It's coming straight through
Come into a mind
Cross cut to you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You tell me that time never waits
That's OK because I don't wait for time I wanna wake up
And find my way out from in between these dreams
It's better when we're together baby
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But you'll never never know
We feel so certain
But we don't know a thing
Cept for when I wake up in the morning
And im sitting in the shade
Eating banana pancakes we made
With all the good people
Really not so hard to find
Theres no other way
When my mind is a mess well
I think that its best that we wait
So im sitting waiting wishing
That you will believe in some kind of
Superstitions baby
Then you could see if we staple it together
And call it bad weather
Oh na na here I come
Oh now here I come Everyone laughed at her joke
As if they'd never even heard it before
And maybe they were truly amused
But every word that she spoke was a bore
And maybe it's because they had seen
The previews on the TV screen
Well this part is good and that's well understood
So you should laugh, if you know what I mean

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

Everyone knows what went down
Because the news was spread all over town
And fact is only what you believe
And fact and fiction work as a team
It's almost always fiction in the end
That content begins to bend
When context is never the same

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

I was reading a book
Or maybe it was a magazine
Suggestions on where to place faith
Suggestions on what to believe
But I read somewhere
That you've got to beware
You can't believe anything you read
But the good book is good
And that's well understood
So don't even question
If you know what I mean

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I said not to believe
But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I said not to believe
I believe
But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I said not to believe
I believe
I guess
I guess it's all relative It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

When I first saw you come across the room
And then you saw me, then I knew what to do
I tried to play it cool and attached no strings
But by the end oft he day, I needed the whole thing

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

You see I knew right then, that this could last so long
I went home that night, I wrote my first love song
And as the days went by, I knew I had it made
Well you could try to pretend, your smile gave it away

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

And now here we are, how could we ever know
I knew I loved you then and I've watched you grow
So it came to be, that I raised you and you raised me
Were lucky that way, because our love can never fade

No our love can never fade, yeah
Our love will never fade, yeah
Our love can never fade, yeah

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

When all I want is you, can never fade
All I want is you, can never fade
When all I want is you Yeah, and I'm just a waste of her energy
And she's just wasting my time, Mmhmmm
So why don't we get together
And we could waste everything tonight
And we could waste and we could waste it all tonight
Yeah, and we could waste and we could waste it all tonight

And I don't pretend to know what you know
No, no
Now please don't pretend to know what's on my mind
If we already knew everything that everybody knows
We would have nothing to learn tonight
And we would have nothing to show tonight

Oh, but everybody thinks
That everybody knows
About everybody else
Nobody knows
Anything about themselves
Because they're all worried about everybody else
Yeah
Oh Questions, I've got some questions
I want to know you
But what if I could ask you only one thing
Only this one time, what would you tell me?
Well, maybe you could give me a suggestion
So I could know you, what would you tell me?
Maybe you could tell me what to ask you
Because then I'd know you, what would you tell me?
Please tell me that there's time

To make this work for all intents and purposes
And what are your intentions, will you try, will you try?

Impressions, you've made impressions
They're going nowhere
They're just going to wait here if you let them
Please don't let them, I want to know you
And if they're going to haunt me
Please collect them, please just collect them
And now I'm begging
I'm begging you to ask me just one question
One simple question
Because then you'd know me, I'll tell you that there's time

To make this work for all intents and purposes
At least for my own

What is a heart worth if it's just left all alone?
If you leave it long enough and watch it turn into stone
Must we all always be untrue
Be untrue, be untrue, be untrue Maybe it's up with the stars
Maybe it's under the sea
Maybe it's not very far

Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be

Maybe it's trapped in a jar
Something we've already seen
Maybe it's nowhere at all

Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be

Looking forward as we rewind
Looking back is a trap sometimes
Being here is so easy to do

If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to... And I'll wait here a while
Just long enough to be sure
That you didn't make a wrong turn
And I'll wait long enough
Maybe an hour or two
Before I decide it wasn't me, it was you
It wasn't me it was you
And I would like you to know
Although it seems sad to say
This was only the worst hour of my day
The worst hour of my day
How long has it been on your mind?
Do you think about it when we laugh?
I think that it's a big mistake
Because I think that we could make it last
Even if it's just for a while
I'll wait here for now
Just long enough to be sure
That you really want to go through with this

Because I don't really want to go through with this
Do you really want to go through with this? Hermit crabs and cowry shells
Crush beneath his feet as he comes towards you
He's waving at you
Lift him up to see what you can see
He begins his focusing
He's aiming at you
And now he has cutaways from memories
And close-ups of anything that
He has seen or even dreamed
And now he's finished focusing
He's imagining lightning
Striking sea sickness
Away from here

Look who's laughing now that you've wasted
How many years and you've barely even tasted
Anything remotely close to
Everything you've boasted about
Look who's crying now

Driftwood floats, after years of erosion
Incoming tide touches roots to expose them
Quicksand steals my shoe
Clouds bring the f-stop blues Well that's all right, if that's all right
Two thousand miles but still that's all right
And that's all right, if that's all right
I'll see you in the morning if that's all right
What would you do if I wrote you a song
Would you give me some loving when I get home?
Or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time
Getting a hold of you? I try all the time

And I'll bet that, you don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes

What would you do if I sang you this song?
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
Because when my words kiss your ear, I'll be right there
The message is long because, baby, this is your song


And that's alright because
I'll be home when tomorrow morning Sexy, sexy made up of plexi disasters
Pushing and pulling conservative rolling
Unlike plastic, easier to see through
Just like glass with no ring
Softer and sadder you sing
Sexy, sexy do your thing
Learn to be shy and then you can sting
Plexi, plexi bend don't shatter
Once you're broken, shape won't matter

You're breaking your mind
By killing the time that kills you
But you can't blame the time
When its only in your mind

Quickly, quickly grow and then you'll know
It is such and awkward show to see
And everyone you wanted to know
And everyone you wanted to meet
Have all
Gone away
Well they've all
Gone away and

You're breaking your mind
By killing the time that kills you
But you can't blame the time
When its only in your mind

You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
Mind, mind When I woke, I was not awake
The light from the sun felt so far away
I went up, with all of my strength
Straight for the sun, from the depths I sprang
And I drank from the sea
But it opened up and swallowed me
So I sank down deep
Now I'm drunken like a seasick dream
In this dream, I am awake

I am awake

Well when did all of the waves
Roll right in and make me their slave
So I went so far away
I didn't look back, I'll come back someday
Mamma wept, and she weeped
She said horizon don't you take him from me
Black sails on the sea
Just carry me until I can be
Awake, in this dream

I am awake She's just waiting for the summertime when the weathers fine
She could hitch a ride out of town
And so far away from that low down good for nothing mistake making fool
With excuses like baby that was a long time ago
But that's just a euphemism if you want the truth he was out of control
But a short times a long time when your mind just won't let it go

Well, summer came along and it then was gone and so was she
Not from him because he followed her just to let her know
A dream's a dream
And all this living's so much harder than it seems
But girl don't let your dreams be dreams
You know this living's not so hard as it seems
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Your dreams your dreams be dreams Drink the water drink it down
This time I know I'm bound
To spit it back up
I didn't want this
Salty substitute, just not going to do
I need some air, if I'm going to live through
This experience reminds me of a clock
That just won't tick
I want to wake up
From this concussion
But my dream is just not done
I'm late again
It's just one of those
Bad days look outside and
Be careful what you ride
You just might find

That you're out of time
To swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home

He's got delusions between his ears
Man, it takes up too much space
And all that tension between his gears, man
He'll never ever leave this place
He's got stones instead of bones
And everybody knows
Uh man, that can make you real real slow
And if Heaven was below
He'd know just where to go
Dive in the ocean
And he'd sink like a stone
And he'd say

It's time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home

Hold on if you can
You're going to sink faster
Than you can imagine, so hold
Hold on if you can
You're going to sink faster
Than you can imagine, so hold

It's just time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home Your voice is adrift
I can't expect it to sing to me
As if I was the only one

I'll follow you
The leaf that's following the sun
When will my weight be too much for you?
When will these ideas really be my own?
Because this moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on

This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own pot
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong
When you're sad, I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one
Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known The air was more than humid
And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting diesel fumes
The bulls were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children were playing cricket with no shoes

The next morning we woke up, man, with a seven hour drive
Well there we were stuck in port Blaire
Where boats break and children stare
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm

Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving soundly engine running smooth
Officials were quite friendly
Once we drowned them with our sweet talk
And we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

The next morning we woke up with the sunrise to the right
Moving back north to Port Blaire
Where boats break and children stare
There were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Yes and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven From my tape deck there's a recklessness
Inflections of the world we want
All my friends, my rusty truck
We're just specks of love, directionless
Call this band just what we want
We can change the name from month to month
Four guitars and zero drums
We sounded folk but we wanted to be punk
In a world post punk
My friend had an old guitar
He took some lessons didn't get very far
An Ibanez with one knob stuck
Said, ""You can have that thing for fifty bucks""
Laura got a bass but it got no amp
Borrowed skills but never gave it back
Luke is just learning how to strum
But since he was the worst
We made him play the drums
Play the drums

You may find
In the palm
Of your hand
There's a flame
As it burns
As it climbs
As it turns
To a blaze
Well this flame
It won't last
Here it comes
Hold it close
Because this blaze
Can be fast
Set it free now, there it goes

Luke's mom said that after school
We could rehearse in the living room
But that sure didn't last too long
Guess she didn't know we'd play Fugazi songs
We played these songs in the talent show
And all of the girls would be in the front row
But in the end we just chickened out
Because we can't sing
We can only shout
Only shhh

You may find
In the palm
Of your hand
There's a flame
As it burns
As it climbs
As it turns
To a blaze
Well this flame
It won't last
Here it comes
Hold it close
Because this blaze
Can be fast
Set it free now, there it goes I got myself a new axe
For chopping all this wood that's
Going in that fire
It's gonna keep us warm tonight
Tonight, tonight

It's cold out that window
There's cards on this table
The kids are makin' magic and
The only thing that matters tonight
Is tonight, is tonight

And all our loved ones, all around us
All our loved ones watching down on us

It's warm in the window
I'm outside in that morning glow
Just before the sunrise
Morning bird sings a song just for the light
For the light, for the light
For the light, for the light, for the light

And all our loved ones, all around us
All our loved ones watching down on us
On us After we spoke I had a dream that I broke
The teeth from a mouth of a snake
That I choked on the teeth
They were mine all along
I picked up the pieces when I woke up
Put them in a boat made of things that I don't want to see
I blew on the sail
Watched it drift out to sea
The further it drifted the closer it came to me
I can't explain

So I took it apart built a billion boxes
There was only one key

You might think I'm your enemy
But that don't make you mine
And all I have now is empathy
I wish that you'd stop trying
Oh, please stop lying
Stop la la la la la la la
La la la la la...

I put hatred in a box then I locked it
The strongest one I made
I buried it all, grew a tree without thorns
And sat beneath the shade

You might think I'm your enemy
But that don't make you mine
And all I have now is empathy
I wish that you'd stop trying
Oh please stop lying
Please stop la la la la la la
La la la la la...
La la la la la... A billion people died on the news tonight
But not so many cried at the terrible sight
Well, mama said
It's just make believe
You can't believe everything you see

So baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
On the news tonight

Who's the one to decide that it would be alright
To put the music behind the news tonight
Well mama said
You can't believe everything you hear
The diagetic world is so unclear

So baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
On the news tonight

The unobtrusive tones on the news tonight
And mama said
Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die?
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes
Mama said
It's just make believe
You can't believe everything you see

So baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
On the news tonight Well i woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Yes I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Well that was God tellin' me
Everything's gonna be alright

Well so long, good friends
When will we meet again?
I said so long good friends
When will we meet again?
Well i don't know, i don't know
But I guess I'll see you then...

Well I'm gonna pack my old guitar
Move on down the road
I'm gonna pack my old guitar
And move on down the road (where you gonna go?)
Where I'll go, I don't know
But I guess I've got to go

When I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
When I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Well that was God tellin me
Everything...Everything is gonna be alright.... Mercury's in retrograde
Don't believe a thing I say
You know I don't believe that stuff
My mind's only made of dust
The echo always said get real
Mostly I just go by feel
Kick it first if it don't start
Don't need tools I got my heart

Are we free or afraid
Of what we're told
Are we out of or under
Control

When Saturn returns I begin
To trust in patterns more than men
Or the stories that they tell
Even when they tell them well
The echo always sounded good
Until I finally understood
I only had to open the door
Now I don't trust the echo anymore

Are we free or afraid
Of what we're told
Are we out of or under
Control

All these planets pulling me around
They pulled my face into a frown
Even though my minds made up
My mind's only made of dust
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen

Are we free or afraid
Of what we're told
Are we out of or under
Control Looking at himself, but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall, they don't look like him at all

So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he isn't loved at all

He gets his courage from the can
It makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies
But the ladies don't love him at all
Because when he's not drunk
He's only stuck on himself
And then he has the nerve
To say he needs a decent girl



All caught up in the trends
Well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know man
There's just no truth left at all
Because when the pretty girl walks
She walks so proud
And when the pretty girl laughs
Oh man, she laughs so loud
And if it isn't this, then its that
As a matter of fact
She hasn't had a day to relax
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly

Well I'm an energetic, hypothetic version of another person
Check out my outsides, there's nothing in here Well based on your smile
I'm betting all of this
Might be over soon
But your bound to win
Because if I'm betting against you
I think I'd rather lose
But this is all that I have

So please
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
You know I only have so little
So please
Mend your broken heart and leave

I know it's not your style
I can tell by the way that you move
It's real, real soon
But I'm on your side
And I don't want to be your regret
I'd rather be your cocoon
But this is all that you have


You said this was all you had
And it's all I need
But blah blah blah
Because it fell apart and
I guess it's all you knew
And all I have
But now we have
Only confused hearts and
I guess all we have
Is really all we need Mother, mother ocean, well I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
'Cause you've seen it all, you've seen it all
Watched the men who rode you switch from sails to steam
And in your belly you hold the treasures that few have ever seen
Most of 'em dreams, most of 'em dreams
Yes I am a pirate, a few hundred years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothing to plunder
I'm an under-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late
I've done a bit of smuggling, I've run my share of weed
And I've made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
It's never meant to last, it's never meant to last
And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I've passed out and I've rallied and I've sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishing, got to go fishing
Down to rock bottom again
With just a few friends, just a few friends
With just a few friends, just a few friends I can change the world
With my own two hands
Make it a better place
With my own two hands
Make it a kinder place
With my own two hands

With my own
With my own two hands

I can make peace on earth
With my own two hands
I can clean up the earth
With my own two hands
I can reach out to you
With my own two hands

With my own
With my own two hands
With my own
With my own two hands

I'm going to make it a brighter place
With my own two hands
I'm going to make it a safer place
With my own two hands
I'm going to help the human race
With my own two hands

With my own
With my own two hands
With my own
With my own two hands

I can hold you
In my own two hands
I can comfort you
With my own two hands
But you've got to use
Use your own two hands

Use your own
Use your own two hands
Use your own
Use your own two hands
With our own
With our own two hands
With our own
Our own two hands
With my own
With my own two hands I don't care if it rains or freezes
As long as i've got my plastic jesus
Sitting on the dashboard of my car
It comes in colours pink and pleasant
It glows in the dark cause its iradescent
I'll take it with me whenever i go far
So give me my lady madonna
Dressed in rhinestones and sittin on a
Pedestal of abalone shells
Drivin 90 but im not scared
Because i've got my virgin mary
Assuring me that i will never go to hell
And by the way
You know the hope will make you strange
Make you blink make you blank make you sink
It will make you afraid of change
And often blame
The box with the view of the world
And the ones who fill the frame
I turn it up but then I turn it off
Because I can't stand when they start to talk
About the hurt and the killing
And the shoes that we're filling
The damage and ruin
Man the things that we're doing
We gotta stop, we gotta turn it all off
We gotta rewind and start it up again
Because we fell across the fall line
Ainï¿½t there nothing sacred any more?
Somebody saw him jump, yeah
But nobody saw him slip
I guess he lost a lot of hope
And then he lost a grip
But now heï¿½s lying in the freeway
In the middle of this mess
Guess we lost another one
Just like the other one
Optimistic hypocrite
That didnï¿½t have the nerve to quit
The things that kept him wanting more
He finally reached the core
Because we fell across the fall line
Ainï¿½t there nothing sacred any more?
We fell across the fall line
Ainï¿½t there nothing sacred any more?
All my friends are gettin' older
I guess i must be too
Without their love and kindness
I - I don't know what I'll doooo oh
The wine bottle's half empty
The money's all been spent
We're a cross between our parents and
Hippies in a tent oh
Love calls just like a wild bird
It's just another day
Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do away
In a mucked-up lovely river
I cast my little fly
But i look at that river and i smell it
And it makes me want to cry oh
To clean our dirty planet
Now there's a noble wish
Now i'm puttin' my shoulder to the wheel
'cause i wanna catch some fish
Love calls just like a wild bird
It's just another day
Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do away If you could read my mind
You'd say baby you're right
And I don't want to fight anymore
You're usually righter than I am
And I'm not a very good fighter
Am I? No, neither are you
So let's be through with this one
Because some things never change

I know you're still my same girl
Who builds her own frames
For the pictures that she paints
The lights of Monterrey
Coming across the bay
Right back to my same girl
Uhmmm hmmm hmmmm
Uhmmm hmmmm hmmmm

How can you be so calm when the truth is that sometimes
We live in the eye of the storm
With everything going on around us
I feel comfort in the sounds when you say
It will be okay
Like a star guiding me to the light of the day
 could follow me

But not with my same girl
Who builds her own frames
For the pictures that she paints
The lights of Monterrey
Coming across the bay
Right back to my same girl
Uhmmm hmmm hmmmm
Uhmmm hmmmm hmmmm Well, I'm just people watching
The other people watching me
And we're all people watching
The other people watching we
We're as lonely as we want it to be
We're all as lonely as we want it to be
Just as lonely as we want it to be
I'm just you, you're just me
It's only true if we believe

Well, there really ain't no use in stopping
What nobody never told me not to do
So I'll keep people watching, watching me now
Finding my way back to you

But we're as lonely as we want it to be
We're all as lonely as we want it to be
I'm just as lonely as I want it to be
I'm just you, you're just me
It's only true if we believe

I see so many feet going so many ways
People passing by, they got nothing to say
All on our own, just watching and confused
But if nobody told me what to do
I can't stop breaking all the rules

Now, I'm just people watching
Other people watching me
We're all people watching
Other people watching we
And we're as lonely as we want it to be
We're not so lonely as we want it to be
I'm just as lonely as I want it to be
Not so lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely All I need is a little sun
Some for me some for everyone
All I need is a little air
Some for me some for everywhere
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
And all I need is some water to drink
Quiet place so I can sit and think
And I find me a pot of gold
I'll never forget about the rain (bow)

Little bit of love

Really what I'm trying to say
Is I need you
And every little bit of love
You give me too
And all I need is a happy home
Some place I wouldn't have to be alone
It'll be nice to have some candle light
Light the fire in your heart at night

Little bit of love
Not that we need it
Little bit of love
No need be greedy
Little bit of love
Because I love this treaty
Little bit of love
Not that we need it By the way
You know that hope will make you strange
Make you blink make you blank make you sink
It will make you afraid of change
And often blame
The box with the view of the world
And the walls that fill the frame
I turn it up but then I turn it off
Because I can't stand when they start to talk
About the hurting and killing
Whose shoes are we filling
The damage and ruin
And the things that we're doing
We got to, we got to stop, we got to turn it all off
We got to rewind and start it up again

Because we fell across the fall line
Ain't there nothing sacred anymore
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Somebody saw him jump
Yeah but nobody saw him slip
I guess he lost a lot of hope
And then he lost his grip
Now he's lying in the freeway
In the middle of this mess
Guess we lost another one
Just like the other one
Optimistic hypocrite
That didn't have the nerve to quit
The things that kept him wanting more
Until he finally reached the core I've got a symbol in my driveway
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
I've got you a brand new weapon
Lets see how destructive we can be
I've got a brand new set of stencils
I've been connecting all the dots
Got my plans in a zip lock bag
Lets see how unproductive we can be
I've got a light bulb full of anger
And I can switch it on and off
In situations it can be so bright
I can't believe, how pathetic we can be
I've got a perfect set of blueprints
I'm going to build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth?
I've got a phosphorescent secret
But don't you tell nobody else
Next thing you know, the whole world
Will be talking about all the clues they got
They're just no use, they've got us fooled Oh, you're such a pretty thing
I'll take you and I'll make you all mine
I will steal you from this patient world let it chase us
It could never take you back

We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
It's not ours

And I know you know me well enough
To know I'm lucky to have you
But all this just the little things
The words that I should tell you all the time
You're so sweet to me
When you beat me in doubles solitaire
You're so sweet to me
In a world that's not always fair

We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
It's not ours

More love that you feel
More your little heart will ache
Love's the only thing that carries on
It's the only thing this world can't take

This love is ours
This love is ours
This love is ooh ooh ooh!
This love is ooh ooh ooh ooh!

Oh you're such a pretty thing, I'll take you and I'll make you all mine Some of us need to gather
And others gonna have to kill
With everybody so preoccupied, who's gonna pay the bills?

If anybody finds a flame
You gotta keep it safe and dry
If anybody goes for coffee
Well, then, give me a piece of the pie, a little piece of the pie
And then we gotta try to harvest
Somebody's gonna have to till
And what about a little shelter?
What about a big house on the hill?
And who's gonna tend the garden
If the rain forgets to fall?
And who's gonna spend
As much as they can
On Jesus at the mall?

Some of us need to gather
And others gonna have to kill
With everybody so preoccupied, who's gonna pay the bills?

Now we got ourselves a circus
Let's put it away for a while
We'll bring it back if we get hungry
Or just fashionably out of style
And who's gonna try to fix this one?
Somebody please stop the car
And who's gonna give me some good news and
Who's gonna take it too far?
Come on, let's take it too far
Come on, let's take it too far
Come on, let's take it too far
Come on, let's take it too

Some of us need to gather
And other's are gonna have to kill
With everybody so preoccupied, who's gonna pay the bills?
Well some of us need to gather (some of us need to gather)
Some of us need to gather (some of us need to gather)
Some of us need to gather (some of us need to gather)
Who's gonna pay the bills (come on, let's take it too far)
Who's gonna pay the bills
Come on, let's take it too far
Who's gonna pay the
Come on let's take it too far
Who's gonna pay the Are they laughing at or with me?
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes
I think that I'm so happy now
And I think this is a better you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

People are just trying to fit in
But is this something telling you?
You can't trust anyone in this town
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes


Don't put your money where your mouth is, baby
We don't want to see you choke
Nobody's choking around here anymore
Nobody's broken any high scores

No dancing shoes have touched this dusty floors
For such a long, long time
For such a long, long time
For such a long time


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  You walk into the world you make
You lose yourself but you find your way
I'm going to watch you
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
We turn so slow I know it's hard to wait
Take your time, sun is yours to take
I'm going to watch you
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate

These rocks they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk you believe
Every part of the dream

I see you lost in what you create
All of time in this one single day
You take it in and you
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Follow your hands as they build
As they shape, as they follow your mind
And rose like a wave
Take it and you
Radiate
Radiate
I'm going to watch you
Radiate
Radiate

These rocks they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk you believe
Every part of the dream No good with faces
And I'm bad with names
Gave me directions
But it's all the same
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
Street lamps are broken
Black the way I came
Who broke the moonlight
Watch it wax and wane
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for rain
Its our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
Its not only you
You're looking at now

Road signs were stolen
Left here holding this flame
Who stole my patience
Who stole my way
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try


You're looking at now
Who you looking at now
Who you looking at now

No good with faces
And I'm bad with names
Gave me directions
But it's all the same
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try As I was saying
Just before you left the room before
Before I assumed
That you might not come around
As I was saying
Just after I took my foot from
My mouth and put it back
On the ground

Well I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

This is worth saving
Cause the sum of us is more than us
If you add us up
Then subtract my lack of sleep
My mind feels crazy
When all these thoughts come rushing in
Should I be trusting them
Or only let them be?

Cause I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

Is it just a matter of time?
Does it even matter at all?
Cause even if this story should fall
From the sky to the sea
If I should fall
Would you fall down with me?
Would you fall with me?
Found my foundation
It was underneath me all alone
On this path I'm on
Now I never walk alone
I've been erasing
Rewrote the second half like this
So my protagonist
Might find his way back home

And I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

No not from here or now or you Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? ""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (yippee)
""Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history. ""
Well Rudolph he didn't go for that
He said ""I see through your silly games""
How could you look me in the face
When only yesterday you called me names?
Well all of the other reindeers man
Well they sure did feel ashamed
""Rudolph you know we're sorry
We're truly gonna try to change"" The horizon has been defeated
By the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos
Well, maybe it's just time to say
Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The troubles just seems to stay

Future complications
In the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers
If machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels
And then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill
Until the drilling goes too far

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away

Thingama jigsaw puzzled
Anger, don't you step too close
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with fancy shoes
Hallelujah zig-zag nothing
Misery it's on the loose
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Sometimes it makes you want to yell

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade away

Fade, fade, fade
Fade, fade, fade It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone

If you have two
Give one to your friend
If you have three
Give one to your friend and me
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
If you have one
Here is something you can learn
You can still share
Just by taking turns
If you've got a ball
Bounce it to the gang
If there is a new kid
Invite him out to hang
If you've got one sandwich
Cut that thing in half
If you know a secret joke
Tell it and share a laugh
If you've got one drumstick
Give one to your friend
Make one beautiful rhythm
Share a beat that never ends
And if you're feeling lonely
Share time with your mom
Share some milk and cookies
And sing the sharing song

It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone I got a faulty parachute
I got a stranger's friend
An exciting change in
My butchers blend
A symbol on the ceiling
With the flick of a switch
My new found hero
In the enemy's ditching
Well somebody's something was left in the room
And man, now that its gone, well, of course we assume
That somebody else needed something so bad
That they took everything that somebody had

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

The mark was left
Man, it's never the same
Next time that you shoot
Make sure that you aim
Open windows with passing cars
A brand new night
With the same old stars

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

Feed the fool
A piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system
Make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies
And maybe he'll find
His place in heaven
Because he might just die

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

But hanging on is easy
When you've got a friend to call
When nothings making sense at all
You're not the only one that's afraid of change Just when you were getting used to this place
You were getting used to these bones
You were getting used to the changes
Well the change won't leave you alone
You finally caught up with the pace
The tough just might have got going
You thought you could trust all the faces
Well they're only on one side of the coin

All these changes
Different stages
Turning page after page after page
It gets stranger day by day

Set your eyes straight up ahead
Don't look down when you cross
And pay no mind to time it's a punch line
The joke is on all of us Well he's not necessarily trying to say that he minds it
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
And certain situations scream for deviations
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle
Of this and that and man he should try less
Because every time he's rejected, man, he loses affection

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing
But still find some to spare
And other people got more than they could use
But they don't share
And some people got problems man
They got awful complications
Other people got perfect situations
With no provocation

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you
Confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Somehow we always get stuck in the middle
Confused, what an awful thing for you to do
Confused, what an awful thing for you to say Tied down against the tracks
Screaming in silent, black and white
Why'd you trust us? We are such villains
We would tell ourselves anything
We want to hear, if we are willing
To listen is to learn
Then too much is what we deserve

And how come when we say that we do
We don't
Pray to anybody you want
We won't

But if we're the ones to blame then the fruit
Shouldn't taste so good, we were used
Used to thinking we got nothing to lose
We're losing everything but the truth
Walking straight into a roadblock
Ending left, here bending
Your point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse

With all its do's and don'ts
The future is an empty promise
Unconcerned and so tired of waiting
We could sell it wooden horses
Full of nightmares and when they open
This all might recompose
There's no going back to the good old days
It's just a phase bring in some new life
Archaism is a dusty road leading us back to nowhere Yes In high seas or-a low seas, I'm gonna be your friend
You know that I'm gonna be your friend. And is a
In-a high tide or-a low tide, I'll be by your side

And the words that she said (the words that she said)
They still-a lingers in my head (lingers in my head)
She said: A child is born into this world, He needs protection

You know that I'll be by your side When you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself

And if you are waiting, waiting for me
Know I'll be home soon darling I guarantee
I'll be home Sunday just in one week
Dry up your tears if you start to weep

And sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself

Lullaby, I'm not nearby
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Don't you cry, no don't you cry
Sing this lullaby to yourself

'Cause when I arrive dear it won't be that long
No it won't seem like anytime that I've been gone
It ain't the first time, it won't be the last
Won't you remember these words to help the time pass?
So when you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby, sing this lullaby
Sing this lullaby to yourself If they tell me that the bees
Don't make honey anymore
Then what am I supposed to tell you
And if they tell me that the ocean
Is tired of her shores
Then tell me
What am I supposed to tell you?

When I can't tell you anything
But the truth
I can tell you anything
But the truth

What happens to an eagle's nest in a storm
How does the mama
Keep the baby warm
What if the wind
Is telling us that its time
And what if we're not ready to fly


Tree tops they touch the ground
In the morning walk with no sound
Hear no birds, hear no planes
Through the mud, feel the clay
Build it up, make it sing
Make it strong, give it wings


What is this place?
Who am I?
Why did we come here?

I don't know, I don't know
But I don't know
That we're meant to know It feels right
It feels wrong
It feels like when you have it, then it's gone
I want more
More and more
And if you steal the fire
Give me some

Because the sun
Disobeys while it waits for a friend to arrive from the past
What holds us around, and around
While we wait Well don't give me no comic book sad looks no more
Please don't use those same excuses you've used before
Mmm hmmm! Mmm hmmm!
You told yourself so many times it's okay
So eager to try
But you just don't know how to come back down

And now you beat me up, you break me down
Hoping I don't come around
Kick me when I'm on the ground
Beat me up, break me down
Hoping I don't come around
Kick me when I'm on the ground

Well how about those people I know that you know the ones I mean
Not so good, not so bad
Only know what they have
And they have only what they've seen
Them mediocre bad guys can really bring you down
They can't be defeated, and you know
They're never going to come around Saturday morning and it's time to go
One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese homeruns over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Nothing's going to change, there's no need to complain

Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium


Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a pa-diddle with a burnt-out fuse
Well my best friend Kimi wants to go with you
Meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
  On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
Mama's in the kitchen cooking dinner real nice
Beef stew on the stove, lomi salmon with the ice
We eat & drink and we sing all day
Kanikapila in the old Hawaiian way
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
We go grandma's house on the weekend clean yard
If we no go, grandma gotta work hard
You know my grandma, she like the poi real sour
I love my grandma every minute, every hour
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
Mama's in the kitchen cooking dinner real nice
Beef stew on the stove, lomi salmon with the ice
We eat & drink and we sing all day
Kanikapila in the old Hawaiian way
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side Everybody is made of clay
That's what they used to say
Until the truth stepped on us all
Now everything that was big is small
We're just little crying robots
Program me
I wanna win the race
I wanna find the place
Where the king
Locked up the princess
Jump the fence
And drink a little bit of

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology

Now who is the king of the sky
Jupiter says oh me oh my oh why
Is the game always changing
I've been through some strangeness
What's the matter
Is the feast not fat enough
Up the ladder with your feet
Reaching with your hands
You can feel it and dream it
I know you want to believe it
Just steal it
Take a piece of the sun
And drink some

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology

Now everybody's in the play
At least that's what the script
Told me to say
I'd say
Shadows cut across the hero's face
He falls from grace
Until a little bird sang
The truth is never ending
We're just here pretending
Let's all laugh so that we don't cry
Let's all lift our glasses up to the sky
For some

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back
And it's time to turn your love
Give it back, give it back
Give it back

I don't want you to know
Let's not go sleep tonight
It's not that it goes too fast
It's just that it goes at all

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back
And it's time to turn your love
Give it back, give it back
Give it back

Why should I be sad when I'm just you?
Why should I be sad? Baby, I'm with you
Baby, I'm with you

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back
And it's time to turn your love
Give it back, give it back
Give it back

Give it back, give it back, give it back How many times must we go through this?
You've always been mine, woman, I thought you knew this
How many times must we go through this?
You'll always be mine, Cupid only misses sometimes
But we could end up broken-hearted
If we don't remember why this all started
And if they try to tell you love fades with time
Tell them there's no such thing as time
It's our time When you grab a hold of me
Tell me that I’ll never be set free
But I’m a parasite, creep and crawl
I step into the night
Two pints of booze
Tell me are you a badfish too? are you a badfish too?
Ain’t got no money to spend
And I hope this night will never end
Lord knows I’m weak
Won’t somebody get me off of this reef
And baby your a big blue whale
I'll grab the reef when all duck diving fails
And I can swim but I wish I had never learned
Cuz the water’s too polluted with germs
Dive deep when it’s ten feet overhead
And grab the reef, that's underneath my bed
It’s underneath my bed
Ain’t got no quarrels with God, ain’t got no time to grow old
Lord knows that I’m weak
Won’t somebody get me off of this reef
And there’s a steel train comin’ in, I would take it if I could
And I would not lie to you, because Sunday mornin’ soon will come
Things will be, easier to say
Upon the microphone like I'm a Boss DJ
I will walk up upon the stage, like it was dry land
A Boss DJ ain’t nothin’ but a man
No trouble, no fuss, I know why..
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It’s so nice I wanna hear the same song twice
Nowadays all the songs on the radio
They all
All drive me crazy Brushfire fairytales
Itsy bitsy diamond wells
Big fat hurricanes
Yellow bellied given names
Well shortcuts can slow you down
And in the end we're bound
To rebound off of we
Well dust off your thinking caps
Solar powered plastic plants
Pretty pictures of things we ate
We are only what we hate
But in the long run we have found
Silent films are full of sound
Inaudibly free
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Inaudible melodies
Serve narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones
Help to notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Frame-lines tell me what to see
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen
And just slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Moving Too.... When I look up at the stars
As I walk in the night
Down the street by my house
It feels good

The light from the moon
Is afraid of the ground
So it falls behind spaces
And hides behind clouds

When I look up at the clouds
As they move through the night
With the wind
As I walk down the street They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man who needs protection
They say every man must fall
But I swear I can see my reflection
Some where so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Yondah stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him crying out so loud
Crying cause he was framed
And the say I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking pictures

I pictured us at the end of time
Holding up a camera to our eyes
I took a picture of you took a picture of me
In the back ground of the picture
Was water running to the sea

So I pictured us standing there
Staying away from time
Watching it like a river
As it slowly washes by


The feed back loop
Is closing in so tight
Surrounding ourselves
With satellites We could be here all night long...all night
This is a brokedown melody for the wooodshed
I hope this old train breaks down
And i could take a walk around
You see there's no time you see
Cause time is just melody
With all the people in the street
Walking fast as their feet can take them
I might just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
The frame i'm lookin through
Seems to have no concern for miles
For now I
I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
Well this engine screams out loud
Sayin the P gonna crawl westbound
And i don't even make a sound cuz
Gonna sting me when i leave this town
All the people in the street
That i never get to meet
These tracks gonna bend somehow
And i got no time
That i got to get
To where i don't need to be, so i
I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
Break on down
I gotta break on down
But you can't stop nothin
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
That you don't know nothin
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass window's
You can't stop wishin
If you dont let go
Of the things that you find
And you lose and you know
You keep on rollin
Put the moment on hold
But the frames still bright
With the blinds down low
And I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me just breakdown
Oh, let me break on Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like boys play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free
And someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found out what life is really worth
Then there will be peace on Earth
Someday all of our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you or for me
But someday at Christmas time
And someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
In one shining moment my heart ran away
From the world that we live in today
And someday at Christmas, men will not fail
Take all because your love will prevail
Someday in a new world that we can only start
With hope in every heart
And someday all of our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you or for me
But someday at Christmas time
There will be peace on Earth
I said there will be peace on Earth Some will say
This place is wrong
These hands are fast
This face is long

Just stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These plans are torn
These feet are cold
This shield is worn
This peace was stolen

Stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These problems they breathe
Their fire is real
And the coins that they keep
You cannot steal

Even when you're asleep
They'll be here still
Breathing out or in

Some will say this place is gone
These roads are steep
And much too long

These plans are cheap
My feet are cold
Cut the knot
These coins are golden

Some will say this place is gone
These roads are steep
And much too long

These plans are cheap
My feet are cold
Cut the knot
These coins are golden

Stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These problems they breathe
Their fire is real
And the coins that they keep
You cannot steal

Even when you're asleep
They'll be here still
Just breathing out or in Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
An' cov'rin' the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you been on my mind
I don't mean trouble
Please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleadin' or sayin', ""I can't forget""
I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet
Mama, you been on my mind
An' even though my mind is hazy
An' my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me
Nor bring me down in sorrow
It don't even matter where you're wakin' up tomorrow
'Cause mama, you'll be on my mind
Well I'm not askin' you to say words
Like 'Yes' or 'No'
Please understand me
I have no place I'm callin' you t' go
Just whisperin' to myself
So I can't pretend that I don't know
But mama, you been on my mind
When you wake up in the mornin'
Baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you
You know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know
If you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
---------------
It's when yer head gets twisted or yer mind grows numb
You think you're too old, too young, too smart, too dumb
Laggin' behind or losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
Wind's got you sideways, one hand holdin' on
The other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
Wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
Lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you can feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer hands are a-slidin', rope is a-drippin'
Your sidewalk starts crawlin' and your streak is too long
And you start walkin' backwards but you know this is wrong
Sunny deserts and your evergreen valleys
Turn the broken-down slums and trashcan alleys
Your sky cries water and your drain pipes are pourin'
Lightning’s a-flashin' and your thunder’s a-crashin'
Windows are rattlin' and breakin'
And your rooftop, well it starts shakin'
And your whole world is all
Slammin' and bangin' Saturday morning and it's time to go
One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese homeruns over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well...
We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain
Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium
Well
We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain
Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
Meet her by the sugar mill after school
We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would
Everything good always would remain Hey... I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play
Sometimes daddy got to go far away
I'm too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep I'm gonna give it a fight
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Wake you up at 5 am
Before the sunrise I'll be your friend
And you know I don't like for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear this song
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Well now....I'm gonna miss you now Mr. Far Away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me
Color in the lines, define this whole world for me
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Mama's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat alright
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Set the children free
Set the children free
Set the children free
Free up their hearts, free up their minds
Set the children free
Free up their dreams and their imagination
Set the children free
Set the children free The city is my jungle gym
Look at this big great world that we're living in
There's lots of fun to be had on these streets
We can take a ride just you and me
It's a jungle gym
It's a jungle gym
Trolley cars and buses too
All the big kids going to school
I'm going to get a treat from the ice cream man
Catch me catch me if you can

It's a jungle gym
The city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
We can take a ride go tell everyone
It's a jungle gym
It's a jungle gym
Sha la la la la la la la la la

These streets have got a rhythm
It's a funky beat
The more I find inside the city
The more I find in me
It's a jungle gym
It's a jungle gym
Movie theatres and museums
Fishing in the pond
ABC's, 123's, bring your friends along
Flying kites way up high into the blue sky
We can take a ride
Just you and I
It's a jungle gym
It's a jungle gym
Sha la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la la

The city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
We can take a ride
Go tell everyone
It's a jungle gym
It's a jungle gym Who's to say, he's not the gifted one
Well I forgot, he's not the teachers son
No he's just the reason for her to say
That she needs a substance in her today
Well who's to say he's not going to see the sun
Well I forgot he's not the gifted one
No he's just a, another version of his dad
He'll learn to love things that he never
All he ever does is walk alone
Man he can only walk so far before
All he ever does is look inside
He don't need nowhere to hide
I know she is all that he ever loved at 17
Too bad to her he was a passing thing only temporary
Until she finds someone with everything
Cause she's what we might call a sugar-queen
See her whole scene consists of diamond rings
But that's okay, probably better anyway
Cause now that he's free she might finally see that
All he ever does is walk alone
Man he can only walk so far before
All he ever does is look inside
He don't need nowhere to hide

I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?
Ohhh, look whatcha did Well I'm a-runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that want to own me, two that want to stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand, and take it easy
Well, I'm a-standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
Such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat-bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win, though we will never be here again
So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy
Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Oh, we got it easy
We outghta take it easy There must be a forecast that you won't let yourself see
So you keep watching as you're drifting, sail away from what you need
Why don't I just give you everything you'll take from me?
Cause nobody owns anything and everyone is free

And that's why this ship is going down
Desperately, I need a sound
A song to sing so we can carry on
Just let it be sung so we can carry on

God fearing people at the bottom of the sea
Walking without lanterns, let a stone skip over thee
Hi-ho away as in the sea
Hi-ho be gone
So let's just dance
We'll waltz above the ocean

And that's why this ship is going down
Desperately, I need a sound
A song to sing so we can carry on
Just let it be sung so we can carry on
Let it be sung so we
Let it be sung so we could carry on

I've heard all of the stories and in them I've put my trust
You've got to touch the bottom before you can come back up
And I know what you're heart is telling you
Cause my heart's telling me the same thing too

This ship is going down
Desperately, I need a sound
A song to sing so we can carry on
Just let it be sung so we can carry on
Let it be sung so we
Let it be sung so we could carry on Well somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named the Rocky Raccoon
One day his woman ran off with another guy
He hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that. He said ""Well I'ma get that boy.""
So one day he walked into town
And booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon, he checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, but she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
Well she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, he said
""Danny boy, this is a showdown.""
But Danny was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner. Ah...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doctor came in and stinking of gin
Proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky you met your match.""
He said, ""No, Doc, you know it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, Doc
I will be better as soon as I am able.""
So Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
But only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo... Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
You've seen it all, you've seen it all
Watched the men who rode you they switch from sails to steam
In your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of 'em dreams, most of 'em dreams
Yes I am a pirate, two-hundread years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arrivin' too late, arrivin' too late
I've done a bit of smugglin', I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last
And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishin', I've got to go fishin'
Down to rock bottom again
Just a few friends, just a few friends
Just a few friends, just a few friends Who's to say
He's not the gifted one
Well, I forgot
He's not the teacher's son
Well, he's just a
Reason for her to say that
She needs a
A substance in her today
Well, who's to say
He's not gonna see the sun
Well, I forgot
He's not the gifted one
No, he's just a
Another version of his dad
Who loved to love things
That he never
All he ever does is walk alone
Many can only
Walk so far before
All he ever does is look inside
He don't need no where to hide
I know she is
All that he ever loved
At seventeen
Too bad to her he was
A passing thing
Only temporary
Till she finds
Someone with everything
She's what we
Might call a sugar queen
See her whole scene
Consists of diamond rings
Well, that's okay
Probably better anyway
Cause now that she's free
Well, she might finally see that
All he ever does is walk alone
Many can only walk so far before
All he ever does is look inside
He don't need no where to hide Well Frankie and Albert were sweethearts
Lordy how they could love
They vowed to love one another
Or baith beneith the stars above
It was her man...
But he was doing her wrong
Well Frankie went down to the bar room
To fetch her self a bucket of beer
The bartender said mrs frankie
Ur loving mans been here
It was ur man... (hey hey hey hey)
But he was doing u wrong
The bartender said Mrs Frankie
Well girl i can't tell u no lies
Your husband left about an hour ago
With that hussy named Nelly Bly
It was ur man...
But he was doing u wrong
Well Frankie she cried, she cried, she cried
She said lordy wat have i done
I done give enough love to my man 
He done took my love and run
It was my man...
But he was doing me wrong
Well Albert saw Frankie coming
He said lordy dont you shoot
But out from under that red camona
The gun went rooty-toot toot
She shoot that man...
Cuz he was doing her wrong
Aboo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo
She said baby wat have i done
I done shoot the only man i love
With a colt 41
I shot my man...
Cause he was doing me wrong
Now Frankie and Albert were sweethearts
Lordy how they could love
They vowed to love one and other
Or bath beneith the stars above
It was her man...
But he was doing her wrong The horizon has been defeated
By the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos
Well maybe it's just time to say
Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The troubles just seem to stay
Future complication
In the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers
If machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels
And then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill
Until the drilling goes too far
Things can go bad
And make you wanna run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade, fade, fade
Thingamajigsaw puzzled
Anger don't you step to close
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with fancy shoes
Well hallelujah zigzag nothing
Misery is on the loose
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Sometimes it makes you want to yell
Things can go bad
And make you wanna run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade, fade, fade Free
(Donavon Frankenreiter & Jack Johnson)
Well we could
Let this love be the fading sky
And we could 
Drift all night until the new sunrise
Pass me a drink, or maybe two
One for me and one for you
And we'll be
Free, free, free, free
Here comes corner winds and the changing tides
We better drop them sails and get inside
When will the weather ever let us go
I guess we'll have to wait
Until the trade winds blow
When we'll be
Free, free, free, free
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
What we are, we are just
On a lifeboat sailing home
With our, drunken hearts and our tired bones
Well I just take one last look around
Yeah, an' every place feels like a familiar town
And now we're
Free, free
And don't you wanna be
Free
From time to time a little
Free
Hey now, now
Free
I know you know you're
Free
Feels so good to be
Free
Mmm, mmm, mmm I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
Wears a smile that can make me wanna sing

She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

She can make angels
Seen it with my own eyes
You gotta be careful when you've got good love
'Cause then angels will just keep on multiplying

Aw, but you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile and you could change all of mine
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh oh In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain Running just as fast as you can
You jump ship wake wake (??) but maybe it's thicker
Than water
I got some good news for you my friend
The man is faster
You jump ship wake wake (??) but maybe it's thicker
Than water
One day you wake up and realize
Just what you're after Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all
So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all
He gets his courage from the can
It makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies
But the ladies don't love him at all
Cause when he's not drunk
He's only stuck on himself
And then he has the nerve
To say he needs a decent girl
Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else
Because the body of the doll it don't look like hers at all
So she straps it on, she sucks it in, she throws it up, and gives a grin
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't that at all
All caught up in the trends
Well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know, man
There just ain't no truth left at all
Cause when the pretty girl walks
She walks so proud
And when the pretty girl laughs
Oh man, she laughs so loud
And if it ain't this then its that
As a matter of fact
She hasn't had a day to relax
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly
Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here
Well I'm an energetic hypothetic version of another person
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here
Here comes another one, just like the other one
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like a him
And so he ties it up he tucks it in, he pulls it back and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all
He knows he ain't loved at all When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
""I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closin with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doin'
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinkin'
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know why they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
""Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
""Cause you look an' you start getting the chills
""Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you thinks it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache'
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown If we took a holiday
A little time to get away
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice
Holiday
Celebrate
It would be so nice
G Love:
Check it out yo
I dishwash hip hop non stop
Down to New Zealand and you feel the beat drop
We work so hard just to live and survive
Were just lucky like y'all feeling the vibe
From my feets to my toes you know how it goes
I eat beats like snacks, fat tracks and microphones
Lay back like jack with a glass of merlot
And you know I’m going bust with that funky ass flow
So my spider sense is starting to tingle
I’ma eat it up like a booty called single
From Aukland to Japan around the world
In a rush my girl says that I work too much
Soon im going to crash like a tidal wave
And I fall on the beach cause it’s a holiday
And chill in the shade cause im lemonade
Well my name is G. Love and that’s my brother Jack J
Holiday
Celebrate
It would be so nice
Holiday
Celebrate
It would be so nice
I walked 37 miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra-snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made outta rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
So come on darling take a little walk with me
Now tell me now who do you love?
Who do you love?
I said who do you love?
Jack J:
Focus on this the introductionist
Yeah more the lyricist in this rap metropolis
More like an activist who will give it to you all
Presentation will make you have a ball
Sounds start conceiving causing you to meditate
Manipulate the lines with hypnotic modern state
We far from the fakes
Cause we never fake moves
But jealous mofos since the justice approves
And who the hell he be having a fit
Well he ain’t got sh-
That’s why he’s in crips
And I identify that it rips
Business of nonsense nothing less than BS(west side)
And who can reign with the all around remainders
A true entertainer
Revival of the true art form of hip hop
Explore non-stop
Entertain ya till ya drop
Well who do you love?
I say who do you love? Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You'll accompany me
When I look back
Your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no cold days only warm warm sun
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You'll accompany me
And if we are in fools in life
Then a happy fool I would rather be
And I'll be glad to learn from you
And I know that you will learn from me
And I don't care where they came from
And I don't care what they must say
Woman you've been loving in my corner all all the way
So further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me And by the way you know the hope will make you strange
Make you blink, make you blink, make you sink
It will make you afraid of change and often blame
The box with the view of the world and the ones who fill the frame
I turn it up, but then I turn it off because I can't stand
When they start to talk about the
Hurting and killing who's shoes are we filling
The damage and ruin and the things that we're doing
Got to, we got to stop, we got to turn it all off, we got to
Rewind, start it up again
Because it fell across the fall line
And nothing's sacred anymore
Na na na na na na na na
Somebody saw him jump, yeah but nobody saw him slip
I guess he lost a lot of hope and then he lost his grip
And now he's lying in the freeway in the middle of this mess
Guess we lost another one, just like the other one
Energetic apathetic version of another person
Check out his outsides, ain't nothing in there
He fell across the fall line
And nothing's sacred anymore
Na na na na na na na na They say taylor was a good girl, never one to be late
Complain, express ideas in her brain
Working on the night shift, passing out the tickets
Youre gonna have to pay her if you want to park here
Well mommys little dancer has quite a little secret
Working on the streets now, never gonna keep it
Its quite an imposition and now shes only wishing
That she would have listened to the words they said
Poor taylor
She just wanders around, unaffected by
The winter winds and shell pretend that
Shes somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here
Peter patrick pitter patters on the window
But sunny silhouette won't let him in
Poor old petes got nothing because hes been falling
Somehow sunny knows just where hes been
He thinks that singing on sunday is gonna save his soul
Now that saturday is gone
Sometimes he thinks that hes on his way
But i can see that his break lights are on
He just wanders around, unaffected by
The winter winds and hell pretend that
Hes somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here
Such a tough enchilada filled up with nada
Giving what she gotta give to get a dollar bill
Used to be a limber chicken, times a been a ticking
Nows shes finger licking to the man
With the money in his pocket flying in his rocket
Only stopping by on his way to a better world
If taylor finds a better world
Then taylor's gonna run away Spoken:
Well, I've got one memory thats always been with me
My dad would get up to go surf about 4:30 or 5:00 and sometimes
I would hear him and go out in the living room and he'd be getting is board up
Out of the closet, like right in the dining
Room where he kept his board
And one day I remember the waves were really good
And um, it was really cool just getting up
And going down there, it was off-shore
I remember just sitting there watching my dad surf and from that point on
I always kinda like.. felt like a surfer, you know?
I always knew that I would definitely.. be surfing forever Well that's alright
And that's alright
2000 miles we stood
And that's alright
And that's alright
If that's alright
I'll see you in the morning
If that's alright
What would you do if i wrote you a song
Would you give me some lovin when i get home
Would you be mad at me if i had a hard time
Gettin a hold of you you know i try all the time
And i think that
You don't know anybody that could be
So bad but if you did
You'd be wonderin where i'm at
Well i'll be home when tomorrow mornin comes
What would you do if i sang you this song
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
When my words kiss your ear
I'll be right there
The message is long
But this is your song
And i think that
You don't know anybody that could be
So bad
But if you did
You'd be wonderin where
I'm at
Well i'll be home when tomorrow mornin...
And that's alright
'cause i'll be home when tomorrow mornin...
And that's allllright
'cause i'll be home when tomorrow mornin comes I don't care what you do
I only care about you
And I don't care what you say
Are you comin my way
And I don't care what your momma say
And I don't care what your poppa say
And I don't care what your friends say
I'm gon love you anyway
Come on and take a ride
Come on and take a ride
:
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
When I was all out of luck you brought me the jackpot
All outta luck, the kissin and the hugging
On a nervous breakdown, I'll tell ya little somethin
I wanna thank you babe, you kept me from boogeyin
(Jack Johnson):
Well let me tell you about a girl I met one time
She got the looks and the books, gotta make her mine
She told me things that nobody ever told me
And as she taught me well I learned
That I love all the time we would spend and the nights
Just talkin
In the morning I would leave and then I'd come back
Knockin
For you girl
Always lookin for you girl This is a true story
I think it was a sign
When your cell
Phone fell
Into the toilet
And then it spelled
The word
Goodbye

Backstage at the shell
It was nice enough of it to tell
You farewell
Before
It went
Off to Hell

Well maybe it will see
Our two computers
Down there
That were stolen
On New Years Day
I never really liked them
Anyway Don't you know
I just can't go to sleep
Oh mama don't you know
I just can't go to sleep
You told me go to bed hours ago but
Mama you know I just can't sleep
It's getting late
I just can't close my eyes
Well it's, getting so late
I just can't close my eyes
I'm so afraid if I close my eyes
I just won't see what's outside
You told me go to bed hours ago but
Mama I just can't sleep..... Don't you know
I just can't go to sleep
Oh, mama, don't you know
I just can't go to sleep

You told me go to bed hours ago
But mama, I just can't sleep

It's getting late
I just can't close my eyes
Well, it's getting so late
I just can't close my eyes
I'm so afraid if I close my eyes I just won't see what's outside

You told me go to bed hours ago
But mama, I just can't sleep She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm
She knows the world is just her stage
And so she'll never misbehave
She gives thanks for what they gave her
Man, they practically made her
Into a mmm
She's the one that stumbles when she talks about
The seven foreign films that she's checked out
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm
She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs about her
She's just so mmm
She's the one that stumbles when she talks about it
So maybe we shouldn't talk about
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm The air was more than human
And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting diesel fumes
The boars were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children playing cricket with no shoes
That morning we woke up man
To a seven-hour drive
Well there we were in South Batong
Where women are men and men go wrong
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven, mmm
Man and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven, mmm
The officials were quite friendly
Once we bribed them with our sweet talk
And we drowned them with our cigarettes and booze
Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving south the engine running smooth
The next morning we woke up man
With the sunrise to the right well
Moving back north to Port Blair
Where boats break and children stare
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven, mmm
Man and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven Found myself thinking of you today
All of your wise comments
And your crooked smile
Saying that the world
Would be a better place
With more Jack Johnson
Flashback to the time
When you were all mine
Golden skin, sky blue eyes
Wishing for the day that you could play
Play the guitar
Just like Jack Johnson

You were my world and you
Moved halfway across it
But I'm your girl, I'm your girl
And nothing can stop it

Cuz I will follow (You know I'll follow)
Wherever you go (I'll be there too)
Well I'm running, I'm flying, I'm driving
And I know that I'll get to you someday
If I follow you

I found myself thinking
About summer days
Staying up late laughing and
Memorizing details of your face
Sitting on a porch and
Playing Jack Johnson

Well you were my world
And you moved halfway across it
Well I'm your girl, I'm your girl
And nothing, can stop it

Cuz I will follow (You know I'll follow)
Wherever you go (I'll be there too)
Well I'm running, I'm flying, I'm driving
And I know that I'll get to you someday
If I follow you

And if I could
I would go back in time
And tell you don't go
I'd tell you don't go
Come home
Come home
I'm gonna follow
I'll follow (You know I'll follow)
Wherever you may go (I'll be there too)
I'm running, I'm flying, I'm driving (Ah)
I know that I'll get to you someday
If I follow
[Outro}
And I hope you like this song
As much as you like
Jack Johnson Two thousand miles but thats all right
Ill see you in the morning if thats all right
What would you do if i wrote you a song
Would you give me some loving when i get home
Or would you be mad at me if i had a hard time
Getting a hold of you, i try all the time
Ill bet that you dont know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did youd be wondering where im at
Ill be home when tomorrow morning comes
What would you do if i sang you this song
The connection is bad but thats only the phone
When my words kiss your ear, ill be right there
The message is long because baby this is your song
Ill bet that you dont know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did youd be wondering where im at
Ill be home when tomorrow morning comes There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
And our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoe box of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

And love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
And it's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's so much better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is
Not enough time
And there is no...
No song I could sing
And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing
We're better together Instrumental I got a symbol in my driveway
I got a hundred million-dollar friends
I got you a brand new weapon
Let's see how destructive we can be
I got a brand new set of stencils
I been connecting all the dots
I got my plans in a zip-locked bag
Let's see how productive we can be
I got a lightbulb full of anger
I can switch it on and off
Situations they can be so bright
I can't believe how pathetic we can be
I got a perfect set of blueprints
I'm gonna build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth
I got a phos-florescent secret
Don't you tell nobody else
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Secret Heart, what are you made of?
What are you so afraid of?
Could it be
Three simple words
Only the fear of being overheard
What's wrong?
Let it in on your secret heart
Secret Heart
Why so mysterious?
Why so secret?
Why so serious?
Could it be
Three simple words
Only the fear of being overheard
What's wrong?
Let it in on your secret heart"
