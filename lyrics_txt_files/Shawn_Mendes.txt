"I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (Mmmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back (Oh whoa)
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood, oh

It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? (Can't have you)
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep going

Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away (can't take my youth)
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth  away (my youth away)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (oh yeah)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

You (Yeah) are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Yeah)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

You (Yeah) are bringing out a different kind of me (Ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (Ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you, I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me (Ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (Ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in... You said, ""I wanna get to know ya""
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where  were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you? I saw you on a Sunday in a café
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're right here in this room

I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, yeah)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

We walked in the rain a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me

I get a little bit nervous around you

You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination? (Woah, oh)

Imagination (Woah, oh, woah, oh)
Imagination (Woah, oh)
(Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, ooh)

In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you I love it when you just don't care

Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunken in
Singing me my favorite song

Me and you
We were made to break
I know the truth
But it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me

There's no use
We were made to break
I know the truth
And it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never wanna let you go

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?


I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you ""Don't cry"" - or do
Whatever makes you comfortable
I’m tired too, there's nothin' left to say
Let’s call the truce, 'cause I don't really wanna go to bed like this

I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

I don't know what it’s like to be you
I don’t know what it's like but I’m dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

Can I kiss you or not? 'Cause I’m not really sure right now of what you want
Are you still mad at me?
I'm hopin' not
'Cause maybe we could go to the movies, I know that always cheers us up, hey

I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
Yeah, I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
Tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you

I get worried
I might lose you a little
Every time we
Every time we argue and get caught up in the moment

I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
So tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like I think it's time that I be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all

You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy

It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I, we'd go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?

You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy

It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose (ooh)
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do (ooh)
I wish I had you

But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now

Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight, just remember that we lay under the same stars

Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you will never be alone Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'

Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

And I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around

And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans

I know your heart like the back of my hand

So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin' It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?

It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose

She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't, let it go, oh no
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't

And I don't care what they, say about you baby

Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinkin'

She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all I want though

She takes the long way home It's hard to believe
You don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say ""nice to meet you"" every time
Yeah, and I made you laugh
I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say ""nice to meet you"" every time

I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations, yeah

Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me

Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

I shouldn't stress about
The fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get?
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand
Why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent

I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around, yeah

Who crowned you queen of

We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight

We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

We're still talking everyday

But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself, she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand, it will be alright

And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah

A little too much
I said a little too much, oh

And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much I know that I have made mistakes
Like when I introduced you as a friend
And I pray to God it's not too late
As I'm dreaming wide awake again
Yeah, we got so close I couldn't see
Laughing while we painted my room, yeah
And all along the joke's on me
Now you're happier with someone new

What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

When I call you late, I know he's there
But you still pick up and leave the bed
You speak low so he can't hear
And it gives me hope there's something left

What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

And when you ask me who I'm seeing now
I wanna say it's you I'm thinking about
I'm tryna find the words somehow
To say the things that I never said
I'd do whatever it takes, I need to know what'd you say
Cause you've got a hold on me, yeah, you got a hold of me

What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait

Why don't you let your somebody be me? Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it, how you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed, probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say, ""Pretty please forgive me""
Fool me once, told you twice, gonna regret it, now you're all alone, yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say, ""Pretty please forgive me""
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes

Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh

'Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody care-ares

I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh yeah-eh-ehh

'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah-eh I know
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no yeah-eh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-ehh-ehhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am

When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
And, that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhh-ehhhhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am You say it's not supposed to be
Tell me not to waste my time
This was never up to me
But if it was I wouldn't mind
And I'm trying to ignore you
I try to go on with my day, hey
But I still pick up the phone, yeah
And get lost in what you say

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down, like this

And I love it how she's honest
You don't find that nowadays
She's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me anyway, oh

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down like this

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
And I thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down, like this Damn, you look so good with your clothes on
And I'm not trying to come off too strong
But you know that I can't help It
Cause girl you're beautiful
I can't deny I want your body
But I'm a gentleman so I'll be
The one who takes it slowly
Cause girl you're so beautiful

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hey, hey, no

I like the vibe in this hotel room
And I'd really like to get to know you
Start discovering your secrets
Underneath these very sheets
Your skin's so perfect up against me
Your lips are talking when we don't speak
And I never wanna leave this
Cause there's so much left to see

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on

I wanna love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on I want to go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black, when you left me alone
I never knew, she was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore, no more

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head in the middle of the night
When I don't feel right, I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back
You say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait One, two, three, four...
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah

Play the Lotto, you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust outta prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot, you know you're gonna hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air, woah

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

It's like that feeling when you're about to win the medal
And you worked so hard, that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air, woah

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

Woah, yeah, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening
Take this spark and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling higher
They can't tell us anything
Something big is happening

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big is happening, oh
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening, oh Stop, take it in
And I breathe for a minute
I think too much when I'm alone
I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside
So I'll pick up the phone

And my dad says, ""Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven’t seen you lately
But you’re always on my mind""

I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

These days are flying by
Weeks feel like minutes
I can't remember being small
I try to figure it out
I can't seem to find out how
I guess I don't know much at all

And my dad says
""Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven’t seen you lately
But you’re always on my mind""

I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

All we can do is hold on
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just, just hold on
Just hold on for me

And my dad says
""Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright.""

I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just hold on for me Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide

Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say It

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby, please no promises
Baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all

You know
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go, oh
It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go

We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all You can’t walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You can’t watch your TV show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
I’ll jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I will build it from the start
I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you Never thought that we would end up here
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard
Used to think that we would last forever
How could I have been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air

Always tryna put your two cents in
And expecting me to change
Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained
Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in but
All I really need is space

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air

Trying to hold me down but I'm surfacing
It’s hard to let you go but I gotta leave

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, I'm coming up for air
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah

Met this girl when I was three years old
We were holding hands tight so I’m told
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two-sides of the story, it all depends
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me
Years flew by, I was less than twelve
Long division, I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me?
Any time you like, I’ll make it work for me
Cause I knew back when if I get you close
When the times is right maybe I'll propose
Baby climb on up
Show me the ropes

Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, mm yeah

So come on girl let me hold your hand, let's go get lost, leave without a plan
And I know you got the world to see, but you know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you got second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, pay whatever the cost, yeah
You know me, not the type of guy to sneak around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized
I'm d-d-d down to be by your side (yeah)
Every night

Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings

And baby when you fall down, I'll fall too
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you
And when the waves crash down
Then, baby, I won't move, cause I-I-I

Need all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you’re lighting up the room caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we don’t have to say goodbye
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To waste time tonight

Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be cool if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

Said your place is kinda close and your 'rents are out of town
Baby there’s no pressure, but if you’re down I’m down
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To just talk tonight
If you’re feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights
We can take our time, do whatever you like
It’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine

Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be fine if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

You make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like I’m just a kid in love
And you make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like I don’t ever wanna grow up

Maybe we’re just kids in love
Maybe we’re just kids in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then we don’t ever have to grow up
Maybe we’re just kids in love
Maybe we’re just kids in love, oh baby
When we’re alone and it’s the two of us
I can’t get enough
I’ve got it all, yeah yeah, I’ve got it all, yeah
And I’ve got it, and I’ve got it all
And I’ve got it, and we’ve got it all
And I’ve got it, and I’ve got it all, but I don’t ever wanna grow up Please don't tell me that he's just a friend
Don't you touch me and act all innocent
'Cause when you're sitting on my bed
And you look at me like that
It's easy to forget
Please don't lie, we got too much to lose
And pretend he means nothing to you
And you could try to make it right
But it's not so black and white
Oh, I've got nothing left

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

And does he love you like the way I did?
And was it worth it the night you spent with him?
How could you go and risk it all?
Blame it on the alcohol
Now you can save your breath
Oh, you can save your breath

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

It doesn't make it any better
When you say, ""It's not my fault""
I really thought I knew you better
Guess I don't know you at all

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied So you leave tomorrow, just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow, just let me try

Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave

Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on

Just one more night lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right, just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning and you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget

Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on

When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream

Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on and stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone and I, I'm keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go on Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone

Oh yeah And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name

Everywhere that I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone, yeah, I can't stop thinking about you

Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name
Yeah I don't even know your name

I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times but I
I just sat next to my phone

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry, but I have to go Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
O sonho que trago comigo
Se acreditar sonho contigo
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar

Que vamos conseguir
Que vamos conquistar
Nós somos Portugal
Uma só voz e um coração

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar, oh

It isn't in my blood
Que vamos conquistar
Nós somos Portugal
Uma só voz e um coração
It isn't in my blood I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And 'am I the one you're dreaming of?'

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls, these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know
Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know
All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know

That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me Taking it slow isn't easy if as far as you go
Is only half as far as you and I both know, yeah
Coming up from above, a little something
And it's only because I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know
That you've been coming off strong lately and I can feel it that
You've been thinking that maybe, you got a
Another shot at me, thinking possibly somehow, but not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder that's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know

That I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have, it's black and burnt
My God this is so sad, it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back

And I mean if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then baby honestly yeah, you're not the one for me

And I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have, it's black and burnt
My God this is so sad, it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
If we bring it back, no
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back
If we bring it back Oh
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving and might never come back
Hmm, I was dreaming of a warmer place
And if I made it, it'd be okay

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

All those dreams that, one by one came true
Felt like nothing, cause I wasn't with you
And tell me what that means
And tell me why am I dying
Thought this was what I needed
But that was a mistake

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving, now I wanna come back

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California, yeah
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California She'll be the one who breaks my heart

Day after day
I will walk and I will play
But the day after today
I will stop and I will start
(Chorus)
I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says ""Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!""
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
(Verse 2)
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight
(Bridge)
Oh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and bought him a gun
So don't you shoot that thing at me
Don't you shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't you shoot that thing at me
(Verse 3)
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight
Add it up! Add it up!

A pyramid is just a shape
Doesn't have to hold you back, doesn't have to pin you down

Let your dreams take flight

Don't be afraid to be who you are
Just scream out and shout and follow the stars
Forget about the past, that it's over
We are the young ones our way is forward

Who keeps tabs on stupid mistakes?
We all mess up but that's just the way
We learn how to get back up, we learn how to turn the page

So we will let our dreams take flight
And our hearts ignite

Did you know that it's true?
Everything is possible
It's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey

(And I believe in you) I believe, I believe, I believe, yeah Something that's pushing me
Just can't take you needs, yeah
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get you out off my mind
Ohhh yeahh
I see you in the morning
Going down the street
I wanna say something
But I can't move my feet
Yeah ohhh-oh
Something that's pushing me
Just can't take you needs
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get her out off my mind
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get her off my mind, oh
Can't get her off my mind
Can't get her off my mind, yeah
Can't get her off my mind, yeah
Can't get her off my mind Oh, I don't understand it when you talk like that
Swear I thought you were joking and that's why I laughed
'Cause it sounds like you wasted but it's 10 am
Maybe I'm going crazy, but I don't think I am

Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe

But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
And the rest was just wobbling
Girl I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language

Girl I can't understand you when you act like that
Yeah your eyes are looking through me, like I'm made of glass
And my lips try to kiss you, but you don't kiss back
No, I don't understand you when you act like that

Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe

But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
Than the rest was just wobbling
Oh, I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language Guess there's something about it
That I can't explain
We could see other people
But it's never the same
You could be in Toronto
And I could be in L.A
And we could wait too long
But it's never too late

And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

We tried to deny it
Ever since we were kids
Yeah, we both tried to fight it
But we never win
We tell everybody, yeah
That we were just friends
But the more that I kiss you
The less it makes sense

And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love

We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love Time warp in the middle of a daydream
Call you up ‘cause the time is wasting
Last drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don’t stumble
We can’t do this alone

Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

We’re young livin' with no fear
Kids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears
We don’t have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh, we missed the last train
It’s that time, and we’re leaving, home

Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Go home it’s over, but it’s not the end
Don’t wait ‘til you’re older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We don’t know
One of those nights, we’re driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And it’s only us now, one of those nights I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can’t reach

You know that I could use somebody
Yeah, you know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the street

You know that I could use somebody
Yeah you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you (Use somebody)

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it’s gonna make you notice

Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (use somebody)
You know that I could use somebody

I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see I've lost my way
And day by day
Playing tough is hard enough
When the sun is out
Tougher in rain
Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
And if I've lost my way (how am I still here)
Still standing straight (how am I still here)
I'm looking up to find I'm tough
When the sun goes down
And I feel the change
Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
And oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
'Cause when I was little I was so sure of myself
When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
When I was little I was so sure of myself (oh) Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day dum mm hm
Da da oh, yeah
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days it never rains, but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Uh oh
Ee da de da de
Ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""Let me out""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why—why—why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares us to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure, yeah
Under pressure, uh
Pressure I walk down the street and all I can see
Is people taking pictures of what they're 'bout to eat
Did you even notice the girl sitting across from you?
I sit in your room with nothing to do
Victim to the screen between me and you
Guess there's somebody else that you'd rather be talking to

Hold on, time out, help me

'Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
And I wanna get lost

We go out to shows, but why do we go
If we're only gonna see it through the screens on our phones?
If we're all here together, then why are we watching alone?
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures
If all that we need's at the tip of our fingers
Then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?

Hold on, time out, help me

'Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost

Tell me how it feels 'cause I know the hardest part
Is when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part
If you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark

I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
And nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost
And I wanna get lost Can I open my mouth and let the words come spilling out?
Show you the side of me that I haven’t figured out?
And I want you to know all the things that I think about
Can I let it out?

Cause I want you to be there
Yeah, I want you to be there

If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me

Could we talk through the night if I told you I never sleep?
Could you be the air in my lungs when I can’t breathe?
And sometimes I’m not quite as drunk as I wanna be
Umm So I want you to be there, be there, be there

If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me

So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, ohh
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, ohh ohh

If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me We run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try to do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while, girl
Our love is on trial
You run wild, you run wild
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
'Cause everything that I do is never, ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud
You run wild, you run wild, yeah

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

I'm not asking for much, I'm just tryna be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss?
I feel powerless and I don't want to split
You run wild, you run wild

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, yeah
Whoa-oh

That's it, it's now or never, I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it, it's now or never, and I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
Yeah

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free

Oh, his smile, how I want his smile
His hair, so Voluptuous

It's Cameron Dallas
Cameron Dallas, he's my boyfriend
Oh, I love him so
Cameron Dallas, he's my boyfriend
And I love him so, Cameron Dallas This morning I was listening to your heartbeat
Singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers
Picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad

And darling, I know that it's dark, but you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm

This morning I was listening to your heartbeat
Singing songs

I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm Said, ""I wanna get to know ya""
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
Said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
Look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
Where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away, yeah?
How do you, how do you just walk away, yeah?

And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this, baby

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
Look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just?
Where were, where were you?
Where were, where were you?

And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
I keep wondering why

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said, where were you in the morning baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
Where were, where were you, yeah?
Oh, oh-yeah (Verse One)
I'm way across the coast awake in bed
And I wonder ""If I spoke
would you hear what I said?""
So I take a breath and hope you can
A feeling deep inside that no one sees
But for no one to understand but you and me tonight
Tell me that you'll take this chance
(Chorus)
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best for you
(Verse Two)
Hold your heart to keep you close
Wherever you want just spin the globe
But we can have the time of our lives right here at home
Just breathe
And follow me on down this road
(Chorus)
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you My head is underwater
I can't do this much longer
I lose my mind when I think that it's over I beg that you read, 'cause I don't know where to start
Though we never met, I know who you really are
Three in the morning and I should be asleep
I'm lying in bed, watching you sing to me

I love you, oh, you're so perfect
You must feel this too
I'm waiting on your intermission
You and I will be together soon

Lee Anne holds me again
Lee Anne, you’re my biggest fan
Yet I know that this needle in my heart 
I'm feeling your true love
Lee Anne

Do you even care, can you never hold back?
Now that you're famous, mister too-cool-for-that
My boyfriend got jealous that I got your name tattooed
He don't understand me the way that you do

I love you, oh, you're so perfect
You must feel this too
I'm waiting on your intermission
You and I will be together soon

Lee Anne holds me again
Lee Anne, you’re my biggest fan
Yet I know that this needle in my heart 
I'm feeling your true love
Lee Anne


Lee Anne
Lee Anne holds me again
I'm feeling your true love
Lee Anne I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, oh
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back

There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked, sing it out
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, oh
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd (be alright) Louder! (we would be alright)
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
(Baby), there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Sing it out! (Manipulate my decisions)
Baby, there's nothing holding me back

There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

Thank you so much Shawn Peter Raul Mendes (born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer. He attracted a following in 2013, when he began posting song covers on the popular video sharing application Vine. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler & Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton which led to him signing a deal with the record label.
Mendes went on to release his debut single ""Life of the Party"", which become successful in his native Canada as well as internationally. Following the release of Life of the Party, he has released both an EP and a studio album, and has headlined a successful solo tour.
Mendes was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was raised in Pickering, a suburb of the city. He is the son of Karen, a real estate agent, and Manuel Mendes, a businessman. His father is of Portuguese descent (from a family from Lagos), while his mother is English. He first started posting cover videos on the popular social video app Vine in 2013 and picked up millions of views and followers in a matter of months, becoming well known for his six-second snippets of renditions of many popular songs. Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in January 2014, bringing him to Island Records where he eventually signed and released his first single ""Life of the Party"" in June 2014. He is the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 with a debut song on the Billboard Hot 100, making to number 24 for the week ending July 12, 2014 at 15 years, 11 months and 4 days of age.
Prior to his signing, Mendes toured as a member of the MagCon Tour alongside other young artists and social media sensations such as Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Jack & Jack, and more. Mendes was also on a nationwide tour with Austin Mahone as an opening act and released his debut major label EP in July, with a debut album due out later in 2014. He won the Teen Choice award in 2014 for Webstar in Music.  (I Want You Back)
Say, I remember how you felt on that day
But I forget all the faces except one
And what hurts the most is that I'll never know
What we could've been
But I guess that just means it wasn't fate
 (I Don't Even Know Your Name)
And I was like ooh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
But you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself, woah, clap those hands!
Oh, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone, woah, woah, yeah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day, no, no, no
Cause I don't even know your name
No, I don't even know your name, no

You guys feeling good out there?
Amazing, you look incredible
I got this little sing-along part for you, just repeat after me
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
Sing that out for me

I don't even, I don't even, I don't even, scream it!
I don't even, I don't even, yeah

I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching baby, sing it out!
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart, no
 (Aftertaste)
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

This is Kid In Love everybody, sing it with me!
 (Kid In Love)
I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you’re lighting up the room, caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we don’t have to say goodbye
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine, yeah, yeah

Alright New York City, sing this as loud as you can
Here we go

I've got it all, yeah, oh nah, no, no, no, no
I've got it all, yeah
But we don't ever have to grow up

Thank you so much! Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Why is it always televised? They want me desensitized
I won't do it, I won't do it, mhm

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You have died inside, and your soul's not worth the price
Don't you lose it for this foolishness, no
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away (Can't take my youth)
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah

How come certain boys in blue
Can be so quick to shoot?
You gotta be the change that you want to see
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
You gotta be the heaven you want to see
No, I won't let it change me (Ohh)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (Youth away)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (Oh yeah)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today (Oh, oh)
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away Lonely

It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin

But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don’t mean nothing compared to her, and I know

When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

I pretend that
I’m not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I’m afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don’t know why I won't admit that you’re all I want

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?


I pretend that (Pretending like I’m not)
I'm not ready(I'm pretending like I mean)
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves? (Why, why, why)
And you say ""hi"" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you I've been roaming around
Always looking down and all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
And all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover through the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you, oh
Someone like you, oh oh
Someone like you, oh oh oh, yeah
You know that I could use somebody
I won't lie to you
Now I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say that you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
So tell me what you want me to do
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better, sing
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
I promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
I promise I'll never let you down
With me
('I know I can treat you better than he can)
(And any girl like you deserves a) scream it out (gentleman)
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can, no no no no no Lyrics from snippet

You got me addicted
But you still leave me in pieces, woah, yeah
Even though you're my obsession
You may never be my possession
You are the freedom in my heart
You have the freedom of my heart
You are my blood running through my cold earth
My soul weans for you because I’m addicted A drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most
Cause you are my heaven
I don't wanna waste the weekend
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go
And as my train rolls down the east coast
I wonder how you keep warm
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on
Still I can't let you be
Most nights I hardly sleep
Don't take what you don't need, from me
Just a drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most
Cause you are my heaven
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away
Oooh Oooh
Just a drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most I'm stuck inside this room, tryna play it cool while I'm looking for you
Tryna play it cool while I'm looking for you
I didn't wanna go, but I had to let you know that I'm falling for you
I needa let you know that I'm falling for you

People everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd
I'm sober, I don't even care
I hope when I walk upstairs that I won't be let down
I just want to see you standing there

You're the only reason I came to this party
So, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party
I came to this party

So, are you making moves? What you been up to?
It's killing me slowly
When all I wanna do Is get a second with you
The music's too loud, just wanna hear the sound of you singing softly
We can leave now, we got nothing to lose

People everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd
Until we walk right out of here

You're the only reason I came to this party
So, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party
I came to this party
I came to this party, yeah

I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I could have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You are the one that I want
And I'm saying goodbye

If she ever find another, he better love her

If I die I'll probably cry at my own service

I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
Doesn't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got

Whoa, whoa

Pitter patter feet on this concrete
It's raining and the taxi cab won't wait for me
I'm a loner in my bottle and I'm lost at sea, whoa
People pushing fast, they must not see
See all the colors in world surrounding me
We are alone when we arrive and alone when we leave, oh whoa
Yeah

You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

It's funny that we thought the world was flat
Little did we know that it comes right back
And you end up where you started, in the place you're at, whoa
Soon as you think you got it sorted out in your head
You gotta let it go and here your heart is dead
Because believing is not seeing, it's just feeling, yeah, whoa

You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in

It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet me down on Adelaide Street?
Can you talk for a moment?
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me 'cause the worst part of all

Is that I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna be honest
I'm tryna be honest with ya
I don't wanna hurt you
But I'm tryna be honest with ya

Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lying
When I tell you every feeling I've had
Was honest and sincere in you were different
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
I might wish I never said it at all

'Cause I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna be honest
I'm tryna be honest with ya
I don't wanna hurt you
But I'm tryna be honest with ya

'Cause I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
I don't know what I want exactly
But I'll slowly kill you if I drag you down this road with me
Don't matter that I really love you
At the Adelaide Street, it's back in LA
It reminds me that
I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna be honest
I'm tryna be honest with ya
I don't wanna hurt you
But I'm tryna be honest with ya I'm falling in, I'm falling down
I wanna begin but I don't know how
To let you know how I'm feeling
I'm high on hope, yeah, I'm reeling

And I won't let you go, now that you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close, always hoping
With a heart on fire

Hand in hand, sparkling eyes
The days are bright, but so are the nights
To let you know how I'm feeling
Once I was through, now I'm winning

And I won't let you go, now that you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close, always hoping
With a heart on fire Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey

Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

Because you look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

And you look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something

Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
She's got her red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done her hair, real big beauty queen style
High heels off, feelin' allive
And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
If I die tonight, I'll be alright
And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime sadness...
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness, yeah You said, ""I wanna get to know ya""
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby? (Baby?)
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin' (Waitin')
Where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away? (Away)
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)

And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

How could you make me believe? (Believe)
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby? (Baby)
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why (Why)

Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
Didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)
Where were, where were you?

How? Woo She's a good girl, loves her mama
She loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
She loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

And I'm free
Free fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin'

All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Woah, I'm free Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boat
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boat
Don't act like you my friend when we rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ay
Hundred bands inside my shorts, DeChino in it, ay
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, yay
Know that I been with the hits ever since a jit, ay
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Woah, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that is lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave every girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
And I'm like ""Woah, damn, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds weigh, my teeths is sore
I got homies, let it blow, oh, no ho
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
Yeah I can't ever tell her no
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
Yeah I can't ever tell you no
I can't ever tell you no I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
No I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
And truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a girlfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner waiting for this to be over
With this girl who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta he-
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we just kick it and just listen
To some music with the message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with this girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to this boy who's throwing up cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be this way
So tell my people that I'm ready when their ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
And I'll be over here
No I'll be over here
No I'll be over here I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

Thinking about you
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

Thinking about you
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? (Can't have you)
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

Thinking about you
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty
In the moonlight
Overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
She cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah This is, uh, one of those really special songs
Something, uh, a song that showed me how important lyrics are when writing music
And how important talking about something that actually happened to you
And talking about something that is true to your heart makes a great song and that's why I love this
And I hope you do too, this is called Three Empty Words

I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight

We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, yeah
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
And it might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, yeah
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further

Woah, we're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, yeah
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No I won't keep on saying those three empty words

Those three empty words
Will only make things worse
I'm tired, I can't take this anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make things worse
We're tired, we can't take this anymore

We're going through motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, yeah
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
We don't have to keeping on saying those three empty words
No I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[Outro}
Cause I'm not tryna, I'm not tryna ruin your happiness at all

Thank you so much Thank you guys so much
I think uh, I don't, I don't really know how to explain this
I guess it's actually pretty simple, but
Um, when I'm onstage, and I'm performing, uh
A lot of the time, this is a very intimidating thing to do
As you could imagine, um, but
You guys are always so incredible every single time I perform
Singing your hearts out, and
As a performer
And more than that, as a person, that means the world to me
And it helps me, and I love it, and thank you so much for that
So yeah, I just wanna say that

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
But I can't stay, so let me hold you for a little longer now

Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight, just remember that we lay under the same stars

Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
But I can't stay, so let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
You'll never be alone
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

I got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself, I'm aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to the flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

I got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself, I'm aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches, no

Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
(Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet
You can take everything i have
You can break everything i am
Like im made of glass
Like im made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
Go, run, run, run
Im gonna stay right Here
Watch you disappear
Go, run, run, run
Yeah its a Long way down, but i am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything i have
You can break everthing i am
Like im made of glass, like im made of paper
Oh, oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
(Like a skyscraper)
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my ...your mind start to control your hearts desire
You should stop and take it easy, easy
What do.. White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
Because everything that don't make sense about me
Make sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You got to know you want it too
Because I want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty is deeper than the make up
And I want to show you what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I want to make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
I want to make you feel wanted Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?
Did I see sirens go flying past?
Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast
I just expected it ten years later
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
And you say oh no
Step on the brakes
Do whatever it takes
But stop this train
Slow, slow the lights turning red
But I say no no
Whatever I do
I barrel on though
And I don't complain
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead
I'm never worried to walk the wire
I won't do anything just half assed
But with the stakes getting somewhat higher
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
I found a woman I love
And I found an agent who loves me
Things might get bumpy but some people analyze every detail
Some people stall when they can't see the trail
Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail
But I keep rollin' on
Some people can't get success with their art
Some people never feel love in their heart
Some people can't tell the two things apart
But I keep rollin' on
And oh, maybe I can't follow through
But oh, what else am I supposed to do?
I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war
I met my personal Aphrodite
I'm doing things I never dreamed of before
We start to take the next step together
Found an apartment on seventy-third
The Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter
Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word
I left Columbia and I don't regret it
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it
My heart's been stolen
My ego's rolling
I just keep rollin' along...
And I think
Well, well, what else is in store?
Got all this and more before twenty-four
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control
Out of control
I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm so happy I can't get worried
About this singular impression
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't, let it go
She's got a bad reputation
But I know what they, they don't

And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you been through
And trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinkin'
I'm beggin' her please, don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that, she's all I want though
Mmm, sing it out!

And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

Oh
Ah, ah, ah, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ooh
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that’s on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that’s on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
Yeah, yeah

They don't know what you've been through
And trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you
Oh, oh oh
Woah-oh
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
(Thank you) I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

I'll be needing stitches
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

I'll be needing stitches
I'll be needing stitches

I'll be needing stitches All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, Show me something
He said, If you dare, come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take–it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, oh
To stay
To stay
To stay
I want you to stay It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

And how many times will I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
Oh, I just have to let you know

That I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
No no, hey

It's not that I don't care about the love you have, yeah
It's not that I don't want to see you smile, woah
But there's no way that he can feel the same, no no no no
'Cause when I think of you, my mind goes wild

And how many times will I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
Oh, I just have to let you know
Sing it out

And I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame, yeah
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Say it
Will you let it die or let it grow?

You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go, no

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Scream it out!
Will you let it die or let it grow?
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart, it might feel the same
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die?
Will you let it die or let it grow?

Oh, no no
Thank you Taking it slow
Isn't easy if as far as you go
It's only half as far as you and I know
Know yeah
Coming out from above
A little something
And it's only because
I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know
That you've been
Coming off strong lately
And I can feel that
Been thinking that maybe
You gotta, another shot at me
Thinking possibly
Somehow but not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder
That's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know
That I can't go back
To this
To her
To what we used to have
It's black and burns
My god this is so sad
And it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
And I mean if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
And baby honestly, yeah
You're not the one for me
And I can't go back
To this
To her
To what we used to have
It's black and burns
My god this is so sad
And it only makes things worse
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
If we bring it, back Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
The holes of my sweater I love it when you call señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

(Would you please have)
(You keep tearing me apart)
(Would you please have)
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me

Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart? I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I’ve been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There’s nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, oh
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

’Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we’d be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
’Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there’s nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
Baby, there's nothing holding me back You're my sun in my day
You're always shining in my face
If i could give you something you want
Let me buy everything you want I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head
Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches Really sing this one out

You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistake

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me--sing it out!

First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you're willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah

I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you're getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're drive--scream it out!

First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Yeah, yeah

And you gotta stop, if you know
So I can start, letting go
'Cause it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, you keep drivin' me crazy

When you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing (beautiful), then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Yeah, yeah
Oh no no
You know I'm losin' my patience baby
Oh no no
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losing my patience And I know that we just met
And maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something
From the moment that we touched
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you're lightin' up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
To waste time tonight
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up
'Cause I got it all
Oh
And I got it all
But I don't ever wanna grow up
Said, your place is kinda cozy
Your 'rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
Just start tonight
If you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights
We can take our time
Do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be fine if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up
'Cause I got it all
Oh
And I got it all
And I don't ever wanna grow up
'Cause I got it all

But I don't ever wanna grow up
You make me feel like I got it all, yeah
And you make me feel like I'm just a kid in love

Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think its a sin, yes
Well I heard mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor, (boo! boo! boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth


Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?

C'mon, Pop. Don't let it stop there I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed I won't lie to you

In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
