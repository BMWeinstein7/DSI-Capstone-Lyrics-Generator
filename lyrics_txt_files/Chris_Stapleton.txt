"Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time


You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Aww, fire away
Fire away Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you

Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder, oh, if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

Aww, that's the difference between whiskey and you Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over


It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over
Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller I know it ain't
All that late
But you should probably leave
And I recognize
That look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave
Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
There's still time
For you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist
All right, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave
Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
Like a devil on a shoulder
You keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's getting kinda hard for me
To do the right thing, yeah
I wanna do the right thing baby
Sun on your skin
It's six am
And I've been watching you sleep
Honey, I'm so afraid
You're gonna wake up and say
That you should probably leave
Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
I want you to stay
But you'll probably say
That you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
Aw you should probably leave They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire


When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood

I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right I was lookin' for a change of scene
You were lookin' at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers

We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
And try to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Beggin' angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'

You and I, we're gamblers holdin' cards that we can't see
And I'm bettin' on you, and you're bettin' on me

One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feelin' tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

When the stars come out, ohh
When the stars come out Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side

And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore


Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
And we sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walkin' with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know Say what's wrong my longtime friend
Something's bothering you
Tell me what the problem is
I'll see what I can do
There are times we disagree
We agree more than we don't
We won't always see eye to eye
But we will more than we won't

We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

If you're on the street, I'll take your hand
If you're hungry, I'll give you food
If it's money you need, I got some saved
If you're sick, I'll visit you
I've been where you are right now
You saw me through it all
I'll lean on you, you can lean on me
I'm never gonna let you fall

'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

Talk to me, old pal of mine
If you feel you can't go on
Don't you sweat, it ain't over yet
This bond we share is strong
Now, your welfare is my concern
You weigh less than you think
I'll carry you through the sinking sand
See if I let you sink

'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

Yeah, we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song Well she said she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleepin' on the floor
I think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Might as well get stoned
Oh, might as well get stoned
Might as well get stoned Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking  my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
And I woke up some morning with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'll have to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Oh, won't you let me take it back

I know I told you that I don't love you
And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong

What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
And I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong I put that record on
Girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah, tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah, it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

Is it a feel good song
Gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving
On past the past
Or the kind that you can't help singing along
Singing woah-oh-oh-ohhh
If it's headphones on
On a downtown train
Or the window seat
On an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny?
Or Memphis blue?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to? Well up here's the window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row

Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know
Death Row
Death Row

When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row

Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go
Death Row
Death Row I get drunk and talk to God
I say I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
And I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I tell him why we're through
I tell him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say, ""I can't be alone""
And he'll say, ""Son, you're on your own""
'Cause when I talk to God I tell him why we're through

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I thank him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine, all mine
I know he's a busy man, he'll help me if he can
So when I talk to God I thank him for the time

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God
Oh, when I get drunk and talk to God There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I can keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Everybody keeps tellin' me move on
Aw, but I can't seem to go anywhere without you
'Cause ever since and every single night you've been gone
Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else


Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth havin', I’d just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they’d asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn’t die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six Sittin' here, it's closing time
You've got your troubles and I bet they're just like mine
Somebody told you goodbye

I know a way, can't go wrong
Nobody leads nobody on
Nobody's lonely tonight

What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need


What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

You be her and I'll be him
For a while we'll pretend
Nobody's lonely tonight Oh!

Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said ""Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own""

Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down

Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

Well now, ten for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind

Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, Midnight train to Memphis Baby, I've been thinkin'
Lord knows I've been drink
That's why I went and called you
On the telephonr
This bottle's got me wonderin
If you could use a long lost friend
Please, baby, please
Fool me again

I love you and I need you
Let me hold you one last time
Then I can make-believe honey
That you're still mine

Woman, oh woman pretend you love me
Like you did back then
Please, baby, please
Fool me again

Baby, I've been cryin'
'Cause lord knows I feel like dyin'
Ever since you went and walked right
Out of my life, girl that wasn't nice
So I've been here in this bar room
Drownin' memories from way back when
So tonight, oh, just tonight
Fool me again


I love you and I need you
Let me hold you one last time
Then I can make-believe honey
That you're still mine

Woman, oh woman pretend you love me
Like you did back then
Please, baby please
Fool me again
Please, baby please
Fool me again One wore blue, and one wore grey
As they marched along the way
A fife and  drum began to play
All on a beautiful morning

One was gentle, and one was kind
One came home, one stayed behind
A cannonball, don't pay no mind
All on a beautiful morning

Cannonball, don't pay no mind
Though you're gentle, or you're kind
It don't think of the folks behind
All on a beautiful morning

Two girls waiting by the railroad track
For their darlings to come back
One wore blue, and one wore black
All on a beautiful morning The postman delivered, a ""past due"" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast, I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee

Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

Last night you came home late, and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And I thought, ""It don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season""
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you, and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete

Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

So excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking, like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

The last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can’t remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I’m sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it’ll all feel the same way to me

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
But the devil named music is taking my life This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My dealer, he's been out of town
And that's really got me down
I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My baby, she done said goodbye
And all I ever do is cry
There ain't nothing round the house now to make me grin
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always had a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind

So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind

Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, til' the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind

If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothin', I just feel cold
Don't feel nothin', just old scars
Toughenin' up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh, man I've seen so much traffic

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough


Oh, a man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

Oh, I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be

I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
Woo! I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get out of hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man
That was all that would happen to me
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be
I looked enough that I could have found
A lover that could settle down
I was known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line
That was all that would happen to me
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be
It was hard, hell what happened to me?
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be I've held it all in, God knows I've tried
It's an awful awakening in a country boy's life
Look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife

It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
Got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm pushin' forty and I'm still wearin' jeans

Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife Put me on a chain
You put me in a box
You put me in a cage
And you start throwin' rocks
I offer up my heart
I offer up my soul
You wanted me to dance
I just wanna rock n roll
I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometimes
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones
I waited in the rain
Pulled out all the stops
Walked out on the stage
And I played until we dropped
I tore the place apart
Let 'em all alone
I wanna take a chance
You wanna take it slow
I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometimes
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones
I'm downtown
With a down crowd
Drinkin' my best not to think about you
Just a fool's hope at the end of my rope
Sitting at the bar, praying for a miracle
I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometime
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones
I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometime
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones I was a lonesome cowboy
Lonesome as I could be
You came along, changed my life
And fixed what was broken in me

I was a lonesome cowboy
I didn't have a friend
Now I got friends comin' out of my ears
I'll never be lonesome again

You can't be happy when you're all by yourself
Go on, tell me I'm wrong (You're wrong)
When someone takes you down from the shelf
And plays with you some, it's wonderful (Wonderful)

I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore
I just found out what love is about
I've never felt this way before

I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore

         Daddy was a hard-working 
Earned every dime of his pay
Never drank a drop of that devil's dark whiskey
And he won't let 
Mama was a faithful, God-fearing woman
Saved and sanctified
No doubt she raised up two good children
And with me, God knows she tried
But I got the bad side of the blood
'Cause I get deep into good corn liquor
I get stoned right out of my mind
I can roll like a stone, race like a river
The sun don't  when I walk the line
Everybody else in the family tree
Turned out the opposite way from me
I got something they don't have
I got the bad side of the blood
'Cause I get deep into good corn liquor
I get stoned right out of my mind
I can roll like a stone, race like a river
The sun don't  when I cross the line
Everybody else on the family tree
Turned out the opposite way from me
I got something they don't have
I got the bad side of the blood
Yes, I got the bad side of the blood
I got the bad side of the blood

         I was born the country, raised in the town
My daddy was a drunk, never was around
I bide my time and I rattle my cage
And it ain't easy, baby
It ain't easy, baby
Tryin' to make a living on minimum wage

, quarter to 3
A skinny pole-dancer was laughin' at me
She said, ""Hey man, you can kiss my ass""
It ain't easy, baby
It ain't easy, baby
Tryin' to make a living on minimum wage

When you receive it
You can't conceive it
Can you believe it?
Where'd all the money go?
Oh, I just don't know

Well, we hit the liquor store around midnight
Ridin' 'round high with 99
Ridin' shotgun with a 12-gauge
It ain't easy, baby
It ain't easy, baby
Tryin' to make a living on minimum wage
Tryin' to make a living on minimum wage

When you receive it
You can't conceive it
Can you believe it?
Where'd all the money go?
Oh, I just don't know Girl the way you broke my heart
It shattered like a rock through a window
I thought we had it so good
Never really saw this comin'

Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl you know you left this hole
Right here in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to be so cold?


What am I supposed to say
If anybody ask me about you?
I guess I'll tell 'em I'm without you
How am I supposed to live
When I built my life around you?
Try to put yourself in my shoes

Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl you know you left this hole
Right hеre in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to bе so cold?

I can only feel my love hangin' on
I don't feel like it's over
I'm still on fire
Why you gotta be so-?


Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl you know you left this hole
Right here in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to be so cold?

Why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to be so cold?
You got to be so cold I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
Get outta hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be

I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
Woo!
