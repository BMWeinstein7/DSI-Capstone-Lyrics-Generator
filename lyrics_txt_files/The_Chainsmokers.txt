"Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
(We ain't ever getting older)
(No, we ain't ever getting older) We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris

Let's show them we are better

If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh
Ahh
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway

Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (Stand by what you said)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

My friends say no-o, no-o-o (But they don't know)
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o
They don't know, no no (No-o, no-o-o)

And I say yeah, oh oh
Oh, and I say yeah, hey-ey, yeah
They don't know, oh Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

R-r-running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope

Don't let me down, down, down I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Yeah, we're united under our indifference

And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
(I'm from the east side of America)
They say that I am the sick boy

And they call me the sick boy

Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

Yeah, they call me the sick boy You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive, I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

(You know, I'm sorry)
(I'm sorry)
No, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?

You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm there, you owe me

Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
(If I'm dead, if I'm dead, if I'm dead, you owe me)

You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho

Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end

So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me (Everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

Like everybody hates me (Everybody, yeah)

I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, ""Poor me,"" I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy

I walk into the club like, everybody hates me

Everybody, yeah, everybody I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Hope
Hope
Hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young

Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young
(I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young)

I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
If I'm being honest When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing ""Summertime Sadness""?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette? I really need one
But first, let me take a selfie

Let me take a selfie

Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be? I want it to be clever
How about ""Living with my bitches, #LIT""
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

Selfie, selfie, let me take a selfie

Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep!
Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Ok, let's go take some shots
Oh no, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, nevermind, I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my god, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie
Selfie, selfie, selfie, selfie, selfie, selfie, selfie, selfie
Sel-, sel-, sel-, sel-, sel-, sel-, sel-, sel-

Let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know how it feels to kill yourself with bad habits
To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another

Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

That, ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks

But, ooh, if late night friends have consequences, cool, yeah

No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want

Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (Yeah)

No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (Yeah)
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (Yeah) She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

""Give me time, give me space, give me reason.""
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

And I know you say you want it now (want it now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though

And I know you say you need me now (need me now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it? I have never wished on hope
Didn’t need a telescope to see where I am going
I have never been the one trying hard to hold my tongue
It’s my stereo and

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God, yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the King of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
I'll be the king of me

Born in a broken home, okay
Single momma let me chase what I was made for
We made out the paradise
Build on nickels, rubbing dimes
I'mma turn it to so much more

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the King of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah

I'll be the king of me, me, me
I'll be the king of me, me, me
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah

I have never wished on hope
Didn’t need a telescope to see where I am going
I have never been the one trying hard to hold my tongue
Is my stereo on
I wanna be like Kanye
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
I wanna be like Kanye

I'll be the king of me, me, me
I'll be the king of me, me, me
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it

I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I, I, I, really fucking meant it Broad Street, yeah, we met over sake
Might have started off rocky and ruined our first date
But last night, when you finally called me
I ran straight through the lobby, I couldn't keep you waiting

And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Do you mind if I see you tomorrow?
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
That you work Sundays for minimum wage
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now, would you think it through? (Hey)
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to

Restless, tangled up in your mattress
In the morning, we'll get dressed, the one that got away
You caught me (You caught me)
Yeah, I'm right where you want me
Every inch of my body won't let this go to waste

And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now, would you think it through? (Hey)
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to

(I like this)
I think I might push my—
Does another night feel al—
If I ask right now, would—

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now, would you think it through? (Hey)
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

And I'm foolin' myself, 'cause I know that I'll never change ya
But you told me the truth, so I guess I can't really blame ya
No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you're just my type (oh, I hate to say it, but you're)
Just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type (oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

My type
Oh, I hate to say it, but you're just my type
My type
Oh, I hate to say it, but you're just my type Bend your chest open so I can read your heart
I need to get inside, or I'll start a war
Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are
I wanna build you up and take you apart

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

I'm gonna pick your brain and get to know your thoughts
So I can read your mind when you don't wanna talk
And can I touch your face before you go?
I collect your scales, but you don't have to know

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you

I'm gonna love you inside out
(Your love, inside out)
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Inside out
(Your love, inside out)
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love you inside out
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
(I'm gonna love you)
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
(I'm gonna love you)
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
(I'm gonna love you) I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Oh, I wanna know ya
I'm lookin' around the room
Is one of those strangers you?
And do you notice me too?
Oh, I wanna know ya

(I want ya) You're a face I won't forget
(I want ya) Don't know how much time is left
(I want ya) Haven't had a moment yet
Ooh

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

Dance with me
Dance with me
(Mon amour)

You're putting your jacket on
Oh no, is the moment gone?
Don't wanna regret this one
Ooh, I wanna know ya

(I want ya) You're a face I won't forget
(I want ya) Don't know how much time is left
(I want ya) Haven't had a moment yet
Ooh

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

Dance with me
(Mon amour)
Dance with me
(Mon amour)

I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Ooh, I wanna know ya

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

So why don't you stay a little longer?
So why don't you stay a little longer?
Woah, woah, yeah
So why don't you stay a little longer?

So why don't you stay a little longer?
(So why don't you stay a little longer?) Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Keep on smilin' until it's over
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't) You end up alone after all that you've done
All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
People don't think you know what you're made of, oh
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
I'm seeing it through, can you not be hateful
While we're alive
Can we relax that, that what our maids for?

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

You're here in the way
How could you stay after that I paid for
Leave any time, won't let you wait
How could you be assured?
You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it, too, I'm trying to follow
I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go? (go) (go)

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
I remember times like that
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go Droppin' bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hit you all at once
I'm already tired and it's still mornin'
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughin'
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darlin', I have to cut you off

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Say you regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human, oh

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

No way, no way you're human

Pause that!
We're in Zurich, at Lausanne and uh
Pausing
Ready?
Yeah, go
This is how the song starts
Hold on, hold on, wait what?
She's got a new song
Okay, before you forget it, go
Okay, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms
Thank you, goodnight! Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive

Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive

The last day alive Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, now you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith
Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?
What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away

Show me that you mean it, ayy

Do you really mean it?
Everything happens for a reason
Show me that you mean it (Do you, do you?)
Show me that you mean it (Do you, do you?)

I hope you mean what you say, girl
Hope you ain't lying to my face, girl (Lying to my face)
You said you needed some space, girl
I tried to stay out your way, girl
You heard some stories 'bout my past, ayy
Wish we could leave 'em in the past, ayy
You said it's hard for you to trust again
I wonder if you're really over it

Ooh, yeah

Say what you mean

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?

Show me that you mean it (Do you, do you?)
Show me that you mean it (Do you, do you?) Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You get real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone

I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Or will I wake up alone? Ooh
Ooh

Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Dark days, I'm terrified
I know that something isn't right
You take what you want
Then you leave when you're done
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?

I'm in my house in the hills with The Reaper
And I wonder if he knows what I've done
I got the keys and I'm going off the deep end
Doesn't hurt when you're doin' it for fun
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Am I in your—
Ah

I pull the trigger just to show her that I need her
But she don't really trust anyone
Yeah, everybody's always lookin' for a feature
No one's steppin' up to be the one
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Dark days, I'm terrified
I know that something isn't right
You take what you want
Then you leave when you're done
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?

I'm in my house in the hills with The Reaper
And I wonder if he knows what I've done
I got the keys and I'm going off the deep end
Doesn't hurt when you're doin' it for fun
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh Welcome home, how's your summer been?
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend in New York
What's his name? I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance as we were?
Okay, enough, P.S. I hope you're happy
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you to eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will

And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're...)

But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...
P.S. I hope you're...)

What the hell? I couldn't help but check your phone
Who the fuck is ""Drew from home"" anyway?
This vacation, you said, ""Going home was boring""
Left out that part of the story on your way
I might deserve it, but I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest, my record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone

And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're...)
P.S. I hope you're...

But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...)
(P.S. I hope you're...)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it

P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope you're...
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope you're...
P.S. I hope you're... I go from ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay"" in .2
I go from cool in my new place to packin' my suitcase like you
I said it over and over that I wouldn't do this
Go find someone new and just fuck my way through this
But no way, oh, no way I'm okay when thinkin' 'bout you

You were right when you said it, keep my cards to my chest
And I never let no one know me, I pushed you out
Now I get that you needed just a little more love
And to just see me wide open and breaking down

When no one's there to listen, I will hear your pain
I know that I was less than, but you know people change
So tell me, what's the difference if we still feel the same?
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

I go from ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not o—""
I go from ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay,"" ""I'm not o—,"" ""I'm not o—""

Deleted your photos, don't know what I thought it would do
And I know what you're thinkin', that's never something I would do
I wish I could lie, but I'm so not a liar
Been trying to try to pretend that I'm fine
But I just end up lying here, feeling more than I want to

You were right when you said it, keep my cards to my chest
And I never let no one know me, I pushed you out
Now I get that you needed just a little more love
And to just see me wide open and breaking down

When no one's there to listen, I will hear your pain
I know that I was less than, but you know people change
So tell me, what's the difference if we still feel the same?
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

I go from ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not o—""
I go from ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay"" to ""I'm not okay""
From ""Okay, I'm okay,"" ""I'm not o—,"" ""I'm not o—""

Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling? You had one job!

Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair, wavin’ out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Oh, darling of mine

On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past, and
It’s that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just want a taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been? (Where have you been?)
I feel so alive with you in my bed (You in my bed)
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go (Please don't let go)
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Oh, darling of mine Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, ‘cause I don’t smoke 'gars, babe
I’m at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
Get high, can’t stop
Let’s get high, we can’t stop
No

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
Khalifa man
We ain't ever getting older

Khalifa man, I'm fresh off of the plane
Been smoking so long I got my own strain
Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
Say you're getting high, but now you're speaking my language
Left with me as soon as we came
Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
Try anything, she'll never do it again
Fuck Khalifa man, 'cos you'll never do it again

I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, ‘cause I don’t smoke 'gars, babe
I’m at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
And get high, can’t stop
Let’s get high, we can’t stop
No

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

(We ain't ever getting older)
(No, we ain't ever getting older) Sometimes life brings me to my knees
Drowns me in my misery
Cuts me deep, makes me bleed
I'm ten feet at the cemetery
Maybe it's all in my head, yeah
Maybe I just need rest, yeah
Lately I've been stressed, trynna impress
The whole world
I'm lost in a cold world

'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

Will I see better days? I don't know
Bet you've never seen a frown like this before
I was told to always look at things a little different
See my demons through kaleidoscopes
Here goes some advice I found
Say it with me, scream it loud
Don't let nothing bring you down
And down, and down

'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

‘Cause every night
I convince myself it’s all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I’m just not feeling it yet
So every time

I let ‘em know if this is real life
We’re on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

Oh, ah, ah I need you right now

Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down

Say don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be
I promised I'd be good

I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be
I promised I'd be good

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you Tell me where you wanna go

Tell me where you wanna go
My heart falls to the floor
Time flies when we have fun
30 times six, it's been six months
Uh, and it's just begun
And it's just begun
I think you're the one
What if I'm wrong?

I don't give a fuck about what-ifs
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is (Uh)
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya

It's a vibe alright, it's a vibe
Feeling high alright, off your vibe
It's a vibe alright, it's a vibe
Feeling high off you, off your vibe (Uh)
Sit the bullshit straight to the side
Our future is for me and for you to decide
You can see the truth when you look in my eyes, even though sometimes my tongue lies

I don't give a fuck about what-ifs
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is (Uh)
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya

Tequila on an empty stomach
See I'm addicted to my phone
That's a truth but I run from it (Yeah)
She said she better on her own
I said I know what that feels like (Ooh)
She had me on the ropes
Yeah I was hanging on for dear life (Yeah)

Take it all away
Erase, erase, erase

Come on
Come on
Come on We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

Let's show them we are better Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I’m okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar

So baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar

So baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can’t afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain’t ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain’t ever getting older
We ain’t ever getting older
Never getting older Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down


Don't let me
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, oh no
Say don't let me down
Don't let me down, no-o
Don't let me down


It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me
Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down

Don't let me down, down, down Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better You probably think you're going to Heaven
Even though you put me through Hell
You're preachy like you're some kind of reverend
I wish you'd turn the light on yourself

You thought that if you wrecked my car
Those flames would mend your broken heart
I know you say it's all my fault
But darling, if these walls could talk

They'd say that you should put down your weapons
Before you go and start up a war
There's no point in getting upset here
You can't tell what you're fighting for

I know you're telling all your friends
Those things I wish I never said
I know you won't pick up my calls
But darling, if these walls could talk Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don’t care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We’re falling apart, still we hold together
We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever
’Cause this is all we know
This feeling’s all we know

I’ll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I’ll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, “Hit this and let’s go
Blow the smoke right through the window”
’Cause this is all we know


’Cause this is all we know
’Cause this is all we know
’Cause this is all we know
This feeling’s all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don’t care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We’re falling apart, still we hold together
We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever
’Cause this is all we know
This feeling’s all we know

I’ll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I’ll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, “Hit this and let’s go
Blow the smoke right through the window”

ヤバいくらいに飲んでるし
でもOK
Hey, 二度と会いたくないやつら
に君は”久しぶり”って
傷つけた your heart
さびた車で街へ出た
4 years, no calls
綺麗だね、君と hotel bar
And I-I-I can’t stop
No, I-I-I can’t stop
So baby pull me closer

後部座席で肩の
Tatoo を噛んだ
ふれた指先から蘇る記憶
まるで昨日のようさ

We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can go from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young

Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can go from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car

It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it

She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
Let's go
Let's do it!

It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

Say what you want, but it's hard, hard
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, I'm calling you up, I'm calling you up
You tell me it's over

Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're...

I'm calling you up, I'm calling you up
I'm calling, calling, calling..
I'm calling you up, up, up
You tell me it's over

Young, caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah

To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore

On with different rhythms

Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet

We were staying in Paris

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris We don't wanna believe it, that it’s all gone
It's just a matter of minutes, before the sun goes down
We're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that
We should’ve known better, but kept on trying
It's time that we see it, the fire's dying out
Can't believe that I see this, we're out of chances now
And I just want you to know that

You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you’ll be happy now
You and me, it was good, but it wasn’t right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I’ll move on and get on with life

I thought we would make it, if I just held on
But it's really crazy, how love could fade so fast
We said, ""Forever, "" but now we're in the past
And I just want you to know that

You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now

We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young

Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar

To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest

It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

Woah, woah, woah
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Taking it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and it took him higher
Oh, I'll be your daydream, I'll wear your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway

I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah


I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)

Dish Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms

But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it

Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you
I promised I'd be good


Good
I promised I'd be good
Good
I promised I'd be

I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I’m older, I can see why

You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth

But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin'

I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah


I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time

All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
People don't think you know what you're made of
Oh
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say, it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
I'm seeing it through, can you not be hateful?
While we're alive
Can we relax that, that what our maids for?

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?
(Let the thing go)

You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it too, I'm trying to follow
I've been to hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go? (go) (go)
(Let the thing go)

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself on my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

I am the, I am the, I am the...
I'm from the east side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy

And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is Bend your chest open so I can read your heart
I need to get inside, or I'll start a war
Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are
I wanna build you up and take you apart

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna love you.....
I'm gonna......
I'm gonna love you

Gonna pick your brain and get to know your thoughts
So I can read your mind when you don't wanna talk
And can I touch your face before you go
I collect your scales but you don't have to know

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna ........
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you’re tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuitton and fucked 'em up
You know that they’re my favorite
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I’m so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin’ to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we’re good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it’s over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly (Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said)

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow""
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How?""
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better


Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

Broad Street, yeah, we met over sake
Might have started off rocky and ruined our first date
But last night, when you finally called me
I ran straight through the lobby, I couldn't keep you waiting

And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Do you mind if I see you tomorrow?
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
That you work Sundays for minimum wage
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

Restless, tangled up in your mattress
In the morning, we'll get dressed, the one that got away
You caught me (You caught me)
Yeah, I'm right where you want me
Every inch of my body won't let this go to waste

And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate

Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again

Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, I meant it
I-I-I-I-I-I
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it

I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
I-I-I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, I meant it
I-I-I-I-I-I

I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good


I promised I'd be good

It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

Then tries to fuck me back to life, (fuck me back to life)
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

I promised I'd be I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah


I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah

And I say no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know, oh You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I arrive
I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

You know, I'm sorry


I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

You know, I'm sorry

         We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, ""Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought ""How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better


We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet

Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better Takin' it slow, but-
Takin' it slow, but-
Takin' it slow, but-
Takin' it slow, but-

Takin' it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him-

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway, hideaway, hideaway, hideaway, hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway, hideaway, hideaway, hideaway, hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go (Ahh, ahh, ahh)
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew

Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they… Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end
So I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like, walk into the club like, walk into the, walk into the
Everybody hates me....
Everybody - me
Like everybody - hates me
(Everybody, yeah)
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not trying to be like ""poor me,"" I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am
So I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me (everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

Ooh, yeah
Bounce back like a rebound, ooh, yeah
Are you saying what you mean now?
Say what you mean

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, now you can't take away

Might have started off rocky and ruined our first date
But last night, when you finally called me
I ran straight through the lobby, I couldn't keep you waiting

That you like your space with your one roommate
Do you mind if I see you tomorrow?
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know

Show me that you mean it (Do you, do you?) I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
And don’t believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we’re united under our indifference

Where we're united under our indifference Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that’s an issue, but I’m okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you’re lookin’ pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can’t stop
No, I-I-I can’t stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can’t afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain’t ever gеtting older

We ain’t evеr getting older
We ain’t ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I’m lookin’ pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can’t stop
No, I-I-I can’t stop

I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah


I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah

Yeah-eah-eah-eah

Yeah, I'm dying to Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time

Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair, wavin' out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
(Oh, darling of mine)
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
(Oh, darling of mine)
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
(Oh, darling of mine)
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time

On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past, and
It's that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been? (Of mine)
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
(Oh, darling of mine)
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
(Oh, darling of mine)
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
(Oh, darling of mine)
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time

And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just want a taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
Woke up on the West side
Woke up on the West side
Woke up on the West side
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time"
