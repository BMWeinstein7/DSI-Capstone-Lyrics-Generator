Oh, na-na-na
Havana, ooh na-na Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe

I'll never be the same

You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

I'm sayin' it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same You think that you'll die without him

Ain't no crying in the club No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the ""Oh, I'm fine's""
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town (oh, ooh)

Oh, yeah

I stay up, talkin' to the moon (ooh)
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in
Just doesn't feel like home

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

Oh
Lookin' for some real friends
Oh, oh-oh

I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then, I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

Been running from it for the longest time

So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no

So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

Yeah, loving you Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds, and I am trying to numb them all

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you
Who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

I have questions for you (He-ey)
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

I have questions for you (ooh)

I have questions for you (foul play, no, foul play, no)
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?
I have questions Baby, what'cha say?
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate
Baby, I don't play

Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't

No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

Something's gotta give Cold, 'cause she has been here before
She doesn’t cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
(Give it up)
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
(Give it up)

Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned (oh)
'Cause she won't like that, like that

'Cause she loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
(Give it up, give it up for love)

She loves control (control, hey)
She loves control (control, hey)

Say what you want
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

She loves control (control, hey)
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
Oh, you know that she loves it
She can't live without it, no
She loves control (control, hey)
Control, hey Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle, but I try to hide it
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find, yeah

Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (No)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (Seem so easy)

I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favorite thing (Mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me (Ah)

Me dijo: ""son tantas las que ya tuve"" (uh)

No puedo soltarte, no seas tan cruel (hey)
(Desde esa noche azul)
Mi papa me dice que malo es él (uh)
¿Qué más puedo hacer?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, lo supe en un segundo

I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
(It gets me every time)
He's put in work, but it's in the streets
(He said: ""girl, can you ride?"")
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him

Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (Ooh)
Your smile's just a little softer

And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick ""Hello,"" and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Ah, yeah)

Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick ""Hello,"" and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (You are near)
And it was just a quick ""Hello,"" and you had to go (Ooh)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, yeah) I should've told you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Told you, I never told you (Never told you)
Told you, I never told you
I never told you after all these years Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I’ll see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, you’ll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I’ve got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four

Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he’d never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""

You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me No, no, no

Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feelin' sentimental
Goin' in our separate ways
But when I'm back here in the middle
Losin' you I couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waitin' for ya just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, nah, nah, nah

Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

So fuck this love callin' my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game, and I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave, then go
If you need me, let me know
Love me or just let me go
But no, nah, nah, nah

Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game, and I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
No, there I go and fall again

Fuck this love (Yeah yeah) callin' my name
Get out of my veins (Get out of my veins)
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game (That's just your game)
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again

You can strip down without showing skin, yeah

'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it

Show up at my door, but I don't live there anymore
Sendin' me our songs, but they don't really sound like before
I was crazy for you, all caught up and confused (Ah)
Love was broken for me, now it's broken for you

You're only lonely

Did you forget
You said that, in this lifetime, you could never get over me?
Are you over me? (Uh)

When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On)
When I'm lying wide awake, you're probably sleeping (Ha)
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Huh)

Come here and sit next to me
You tell me, ""Baby, just say it"" (Say it, say it)
Warnin' me it's a mistake
I just know I gotta make it (And I got bad, bad)

Bad, bad, bad kind of butterflies (And I got bad, bad)
Like when you got something to hide (Ooh)
Lies, tellin' you that I'm alright
Tonight, tonight (Oh, I got bad, bad)
Bad, bad butterflies in my chest (In my chest, chest)
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head (My head, yeah)
And I, and I (My head, yeah)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Oh

Oh, I'm scared if I look in your eyes, I might see your soul
I know love is the loneliest place when you fall alone

Sitting by the phone, holding onto hope
Spending all night wondering why you let me go (You let me go)
I wish you had felt how you're feeling two years ago
Oh, nah

Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face

That's when you said
""How can I be your friend when I know the way you taste?
It's almost 2 AM and I can't ask you to stay""
I don't know what's worse, getting broken or making it break
Oh, ah

Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

Hurts me to hurt you, babe
Feels like there's nothing that I can say
Hurts me to hurt you, babe
Kills me I have to walk away
'Cause I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

The same, oh yeah
The same, oh
The same, oh yeah, oh yeah
The same
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feel all the pain
Let go of the wheel, it's the borderline
Now I’m seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touching me
Suddenly, I’m a fiend and you’re all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It’s you, babe
And I’m a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You’re to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I’ll never be the same
It’s you, babe
And I’m a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You’re to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I’ll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
He said, ""Stop playing it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Suddenly, I’m a fiend and you’re all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

He's a shy singer most of the time
Unless it's him and I
He's an over-thinker, he's a slow kisser
A confessed sinner all of the time
When it's him and I

Hello, how are you? How you've been?
Lately I wonder how it feels to steal your kiss
Nothing much, just fine I'm doing well
And you can read between the lines but God, I fell

I only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
I told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon, about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too

Silence. Too loud. Say it, not now

So how are you? How you've been?
Lately I wonder how it feels to taste your lips
Nothing much, just fine I'm doing well
And you can read between the lines but God, I fell

I only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
I told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon, about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too
That I give it all to you, I give it all to you, I give it all to you
I only told the moon

Ah-ah-ah-ah
And another love song will play on the radio, you know
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, and I’ll wait for the moon to lean in close and say…

That he only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
He told me that he’s scared that all his thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon, about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell this to her too

That I give it all to you, I give it all to you, I give it all to you
We only told the moon
We only told the moon
Only told the moon I might say sorry way too much
Unnecessarily nervous
I feel every damn thing again
The sound of your name like a cut

I tried to hold the pieces inside
The tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I’m left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue
Ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Secretly dangerous
The hurt that you’re capable of
I couldn't see you coming if I tried
You pull the trigger and hide

I tried to hold the pieces inside
The tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I'm left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

It seems the floor's getting colder since I laid on it
And I held hands with the car cause he was late on it
I did my liner, put on but she's on his phone fronting
(Look at him fronting, look, look at him fronting)
Cause it's 3 AM and it ain't the same
And the sign is clear when the phone don't ring
Why, oh, why
She said a dream is a wish your heart makes
And he's a sad reality

Cinderella never asked for a prince (no)

If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Once upon a time there was a boy with a face divine
But he couldn't understand how to be a gentleman
And so the lady said farewell, she deserved better for real
And now he's crying alone
Cause she sassed him with this song, oh

Cinderella never asked for a prince, (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon

Because I wish his hands were yours

So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know

I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say
I think we should trade
We'll tell him let's go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
And call it the exchange

Blink twice if it's true
But do you think about it too (you, you do)
You said you're running out with her
It tells me that you do (I know that you do)
There's beats that I've been skippin'
When my head is on your chest (you, you do)
And you know if it were us two
It'd be cardiac arrest

I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you

I woke up just to check if my phone decides to whisper
You said you needed time so I made the clock move quicker
Honestly, you were my only friend

Look for you in everyone and all it does it feed the
Urge to call you up so I made myself delete ya
Jenny said it's the right thing to do

Tell me is it;
Loud where you are dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore? (oh-oh)

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doin' for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissing me softly
Holding me, whispering quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feeling I'm finding
Where the hell have you been hiding?
We'll tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told

Now we're walking hand-in-hand
In an English town
Gonna meet your momma and dad
And I'm nervous now
Now I'm in your home
Eating Sunday roast
And I say the wrong thing
Then you catch my eye, give me a smile
Say you fit right in

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doin' for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissing me softly
Holding me, whispering quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feeling I'm finding
Where the hell have you been hiding?
We'll tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told

Funny how no one knows all of our inside jokes
You know my demons by name, I know your beautiful soul
All of the secret we keep, you know that I'll never leave

So just keep kissing me softly
Holding me, whispering quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been told
Never been easy
It's a new feeling I'm finding
Where the hell have you been hiding?
We'll tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told

And yet, there's still so much left to unfold
The greatest love story that's never been told It's only natural, I need some love from you
I might pull up on you
It's only human to wanna do the things we do Accidentally made a joke that killed your boner
And I woke up so hungover
And I didn’t even drink that much last night
And I hurt your feelings on the phone ‘cause I’m PMSing
And you sent the sweetest message
I forgot to reply and I couldn't even tell you why

Most days I’m hilarious, confident, and I don’t get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I’m just not killin’ it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha, gotta laugh
Someone please give me a break
It’s written on my face
I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow, babe
I'm not killing it today
No no no no no
No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

Accidentally I sneezed and peed little
Looked in the mirror and my thighs jiggled
And it helps when you tell me I'm perfect but not this time

Most days I’m hilarious, confident, and I don’t get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I’m just not killin’ it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha, gotta laugh
Someone please give me a break
It’s written on my face
I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow, babe
I'm not killing it today
No no no no no
No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

I’m just not killin’ it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha, gotta laugh
Someone please give me a break
It’s written on my face
I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow, babe
I'm not killing it today
No no no no no
No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I liked
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It’s complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good that you can’t explain it
What can I say? It's complicated

Nothing is that bad if it feels good
So you come back like I knew you would
And we're both wild and the night's young
And you're my drug, breathe you into my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratching my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss

I want you forever even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like
I want you forever even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can look at you whenever, yeah

Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I liked
Don’t think that I can explain it
What can I say? It’s complicated
Don't matter what you say, don’t matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated

The way we love is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it, just you and me
Cause we’re just living between the sheets

I want you forever even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like
I want you forever even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can look at you whenever, yeah

Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I liked
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the souls that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mhm

Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
From loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences
Loving you Dum, dum-dum-dum
Dum, dum-dum-dum

I lose myself when you start talkin'
There's something riveting about you, it's got me confused
If we went back to your apartment
Would you be a gentleman and a bad boy too?

I know you think, I'm innocent
Little do you know where my mind has been?
I don't have much experience
Could you relieve me of my ignorance?
It's true (It's true, it's true)
Been wondering about you

I'm just cu—, I'm just curious
What you do, just got the two of us

Don't look into her eyes or you'll be crying like a child
'Cause Tupperware has just as much plastic as her soul
But Bill Gates don't got the green to put a heart where there's a hole

All you got is you, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
All you got is you, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
Always braggin' 'bout your money, but who'll hold you at night, honey?
You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills

And really I feel bad she's dressed in Gucci and her gloom
She's listenin' to urban and she's livin' the blues
But she ain't feel so bad for steppin' over me and you
So I guess I don't feel bad for writing a song about her, oops

All you got is you, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
All you got is you, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
Always braggin' 'bout your money, but who'll hold you at night, honey?
You, booze

She has a spray tan, with no man, ain't gettin' no love on Instagram
Well, next time you condescend and make people feel like dirt again
You'll smile that smile of ""Yes, I won, I'm so important""
I'm gonna play this song and the whole world will sing along

All you got is you, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
All you got is you, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
Always braggin' 'bout your money, but who'll hold you at night, honey?
You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills


Who's gonna cry for ya, baby?
Who's gonna cry for ya, baby?
Who's gonna cry for ya, baby?
Tell me who's gonna cry for you?

You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
Always braggin' 'bout your money, but who'll hold you at night, honey?
You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills

She's a California queen with caffeine for a smile
Once you hear this song on the radio, I bet you'll leave it on a while
You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills
All you got is you, booze
Always braggin' 'bout your money, but who'll hold you at night, honey?
You, booze, and those cozy dollar bills Listen, ‘cause this will be the last time honey
Oh I would, listen, just say the words so I can disappear
‘Cause one day I’m all that you need and then you don’t text me for two weeks
You think I wait patiently?
Don’t make it too complicated
Either you leave it or take it
Don’t come running back to me

So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
If you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good
So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
If you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good
I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, just leave for good
I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, just leave for good
So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
If you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good

Listen, ""keeps playing with your mind"" I tell myself
Now I have visions he'll take me off the highest shelf
And I know, and I know, and I know
‘Cause one day I’m all that you need and then you don’t text me for two weeks
You think I sit patiently?
Don’t make it too complicated
Either you leave it or take it
Don’t come running back to me

So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
If you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good
So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
But if you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good
I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, just leave for good
I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, just leave for good
So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
If you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good

Listen, ‘cause this will be the last time honey
So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
If you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good
So are you gonna stay, I wish you would
But if you’re gonna leave, then baby leave for good I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Won't say I'm yours, won't say I'm not
I'm somewhere between, while you’re at the bar downtown
It's been a month and we’re getting close
But not close enough, to love you or hate you now
In the morning, you look like an angel
But the devil's buying you a table
Serving a drink, you're making your rounds
Picture it all, I'm out of my mind right now

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you had, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, but I
I had to see it with my own eyes

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't (I know that you think I don't)
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Ahh Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned! They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)

I had to say, ""No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it""
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber

Lay awake thinking of every single ""What if,"" I admit
Never felt like this

Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified

I've been waiting all my life for ya
Every night I wanna die for ya
I don't never wanna cry for ya
Need you to stay
Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified (Terrified)

Whether I'm asleep or awake
Can't get you out of my brain
Whеn I'm in the car, it's getting hard
And I wind up at your place
Arе you asleep? Be awake
I need to kiss your face
Those green eyes, these L.A. skies
I hope they here to stay, yeah

Save me, save me, I'm falling in love with this kiss (On my lips)
I'm so high, I'm so high that it's making me sick (Makes me sick)

You can be a winner
So let the small victories guide you
Everything you're begins feels good today I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
But I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

Oh, I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to, mmm
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you, without you
I need somebody to heal, somebody to have
Somebody to heal, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
But I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
But I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved Baby, yeah you got me

Control A bus. The yellow lighting of the gas station against the dark hours of midnight. Fast asleep. Silence. My head slumped over my mom's shoulder. Her voice timid and hesitant as she stumbled through a sentence in English at the cash register. A Winnie the Pooh journal. These are the things I remember when I think of when my mom and I immigrated to America.
I was almost 7 at the time, born in Havana, Cuba. My papá is puro Mexicano and we lived back and forth between the heat of Havana and the concrete jungle of Mexico City. I didn't realize it then, but, boy, does it hit me now. I realize how scary it must have been for them. For my mom to leave the streets of Havana where our neighbors were our friends, where we gathered every holiday to eat pork and my grandma's rice and beans, to not hear the malecón and the heartbeat of her city pulsing with every crash of the wave. For my Dad to leave behind his four brothers and sisters, the memory of his parents, the street vendors selling the elotes con mayonesa that I would beg him to get in the mornings before school, the best friends he'd grown up with . . . everything. To decide to start from the ground up.
With a couple hundred dollars, the clothes on our backs, no family in the United States, and no clue of what was going to happen next, that's exactly what we did. Like my mom said, ""I don't know where I'm going, but I can't stay here."" And that was enough.
Why were we packing up our stuff? Why was my grandma hugging me tighter than usual? Where were we going? ""We're going to Disney World!"" That's what my Mom told me when we were crossing the border. She packed a little backpack with my Winnie the Pooh journal and my doll, and we crossed the border from Mexico to the US, seeing my Dad become an ant in the distance as he stayed behind.
Just Disney World. Whenever I have to make a decision now and I'm afraid, my mom always reminds me of that day. ""That day, I knew if I thought about it, fear would make me turn back. That's why when you're afraid, you force yourself to jump. You don't think, you just jump,"" she says to me.
After she sat down with the immigration officer in a tiny office, we and a bunch of people from other countries with similar hopes were placed in rooms with tiny beds in them, a hotel full of these rooms. It was me and my mom and two other families in a little room waiting for somebody to come in and let us know if we were going to be granted permission to enter the US or be sent back. Some people spent days there, some spent weeks in agonizing anxiety over what the answer would be. Meanwhile, I was wondering when the heck we were going to get to Disney. We were there only a day when we finally got the news. The room bursted with joy, everybody around me clapping and hugging and screaming and crying! And me yelling out ""Yay! We're all going to Disney!"" Little did I know.
Little me and my mamá ended up on a Greyhound bus to Miami that took 36 hours — that's where I have my most vivid memories. Other stuff I vaguely remember and know from stories my parents told me years after. But I remember writing in my Winnie the Pooh journal a lot on that bus ride.
We got to Miami and moved into my grandpa's colleague's house who later became my godmother. My mom was a very good architect in Cuba, but when she came to America none of the degrees she earned in Cuba counted, so to make enough to keep us fed and put me into school she began stacking shoes in Marshalls and going to school at night to take courses in English, all while taking me to and from school and helping me with my homework all by herself, alone in a strange country. I can't imagine how frustrating it must have been for her to have worked her whole life in architecture and then have it all erased when she came here.
One day, as if God was listening, two elderly Cuban women were conversing with her and told her: ""Oye, tu estás muy bonita para trabajar en Marshalls. Where are you from?"" My mom told her the story of how she was Cuban and she was actually an architect. You wouldn't believe it, but the two Cuban women said they had a brother who worked in architecture and needed someone who worked in Autocad, a complicated architectural computer program. They asked her: ""Do you know Autocad?"" Internally, my mom was like ""Autocad? What the hell is Autocad? We use pencil and paper where I'm from."" But to the ladies, she said: ""Autocad? Of course. Yes, of course. I can do that."" She learned how to use the program in a week and made enough to move us out of my godmother's house and into an apartment.
She learned fast because she literally had to in order to survive. Immigrants have one thing in common: Hunger. I don't mean it literally, although that's true too, but metaphorically. The hunger to do the impossible because you have no choice, because you came too damn far, because you've known what struggling is, and you're not going to take an opportunity for granted. The hunger and ability to win above people with better circumstances than you simply because you want it badly enough.
Long story short, my papá came over from Mexico a year and a half later — I had a little calendar in my room counting down the days — because he couldn't stand being away from us. He went through such hardship to cross the Mexican border and had it harder than my mom and I did, literally risking his life for his family to physically make it here. When he first came to the US, he started off washing cars in front of Dolphin Mall in the blistering Miami heat. But we kept moving on up . . . with the Latin community in Miami, helping each other up as we did it. Slowly and slowly my parents kept working and climbing and ended up forming a construction company together named after my sister and I. They always pushed me to focus on my studies because the whole reason we came here was so my sister and I could have better opportunities in life than they did. They said: ""Money comes and goes, but your education, lo que tienes aquí (and they would point to my head while saying that), nobody can ever take that away from you."" They let me know that in order to go a good college I had to get a scholarship, so I worked as hard as I could. However — plot twist! — that didn't quite go the way we thought it would.
You see, in 9th grade, a little girl who had never sung in front of people before asked her parents if they could take her to Greensboro, NC, to audition for a little show called The X Factor. Yikes! I had never sang in front of people before. Well, did my mom know Autocad? No. Did I know how to perform on a stage on TV? No. But I wanted it badly enough, and I learned from my family that if you work hard enough and you want it badly enough, you can do the impossible.
I was wrong about one thing. My mamá and papá did not leave everything behind, they brought it with them. My grandma still makes pork and rice and beans every holiday like she did, and my mom still feels the waves of the malecón in her heartbeat because she still feels the most at peace when she's by the sea. My grandma and dad still get drunk and sing Luis Miguel in the kitchen. We found our favorite Taco spot in Miami (I capitalized Taco because they are that good). And whenever we find another person from our country, we freak out. ""¿De qué parte?"" Because we have home in us. Because we brought it with us. Every Cuban brought it with them and so we have Miami. Mexicans brought it and so we have the best Mexican food ever. The Italians brought it and so we have pizza. The Swedish brought it and we have great pop songs. The list goes on and on. And so, that's why when I hear a bigoted, racist man with power and influence speak with anger and ill-will about immigrants, I think ""what a fool.""
I am so proud to be Cuban-Mexican. This country was built on immigrants. People who were brave enough to start over. How strong we are to leave behind everything we know in hopes of something better. We are not fearless, we just have dreams bigger than our fears. We jump. We run. We swim, we move mountains, we do whatever it takes. And so next time, when anybody wants to tell you they want to build a ""wall"" on our border, remember behind that wall is struggle, determination, hunger. Behind that wall, could be the next cure for cancer, the next scientist, the next artist, the next drummer, the next anything they work hard enough to become!

Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little

I know we had all good intentions

So pull me closer

In the middle, middle What do I know about love?
Nothing
Where does the love go when it runs out? When does it leave? Why does it die?
Do you kill it in one violent blow?
Or is it a million unattended, unhealed little cuts and scratches?
What do I know about love?
Everything
It creeps into my chest, uninvited and untameable
I know love has no mercy on anyone, rich, poor, independent codependent, confident, insecure
It'll bring you to your knees - if you did it right
What I know for sure about love is that you never come out of it the same
The other person is a chemical and I am a chemical and we both will come out as different people than when we met
I know when you're in love, kissing is everything
Because words aren't the only way to tell someone how you feel
I know when you fall in love you feel like you're the first and only two people in the world
Every kiss, every touch, every caress is like something you feel nobody has ever felt before
And you think - has everybody that's fallen in love before just walked around this nonchalantly the whole time?
You're at a restaurant with your friends and you can feel it, this
secret under your tongue
Burning like fire
But sweet
And it creeps up to your cheeks and makes you smile
And suddenly you look down and you see your heart's veins reaching, reaching, clinging to someone else's heart
I've learned a lot about love in my 20s, but not enough to maintain any control in the face of its power
And for every new thing I learned, there was something else I couldn't understand
All I know is love changes you
If you're lucky, to something better
What I know for sure is falling in love with life itself makes an artist out of everyone
I thought I was making art before
Writing songs was me making art but...
Now I want my life to be the work of art
And my songwriting to be the camera that I take a picture of it with
It's what I'm living
That's the art
What do I know about love?
Maybe nothing
And that's why it's everything

Catching teardrops in my hands
Only silence, as it's ending, like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?

You can take every thing I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper (no-oh)
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground

Comes alive at midnight, every night
Mama doesn't trust him, my oh my
He's only here for one thing, but, so am I

Uh, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe

DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
Tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
Kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Beamer
She know what she want, make me take it off when she see me
I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
""No disrespect, do it safe or you can keep it""
I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'ma call her away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, and you might end up catchin' a fever

I swear on my life that I've been a good girl, no, no
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

They say he likes a good time, my oh my

You took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (Baby)

The things we could but you
Don’t feel the same and it’s making me insane
And I know i’ll think about it anyway because

Unless it's him and I
He's an over-thinker, he's a slow kisser
A confessed sinner all of the time
When it's him and I

And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
