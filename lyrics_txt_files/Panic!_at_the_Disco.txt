"High, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision

Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes) Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
""What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!‚Äù, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
""And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore""

I chime in with a ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of

Oh, well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way
I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne
Oh! Well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way
I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne
Pour the champagne

I chime in with a ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of

Poise and rationality
Again

I chime in ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of

Poise and rationality
Again Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter, at the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor


The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor (Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)

Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Dynasty decapitated, you just might see a ghost tonight

(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
And if you don't know, now you know

I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh yeah
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)

Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die

(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
And if you don't know, now you know

I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah

Mortal kings are ruling castles
Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)

I'm taking back, back, taking back, back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah

Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in) This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-woah-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my...

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells, insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

(Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-woah-oh)
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my...

Don't try and sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

(Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah, oh-oh)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh)
The fear, the fear of falling apart
(Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah, oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh)

This is the beat of my...)
The fear of falling apart Cold open


Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah


And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I, I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
To be better than I could have ever been
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
I could be better, but, baby
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

It's Saturday, Saturday, it's Saturday
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, swear to God, swear to God
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah I don't wanna hear you've got a boyfriend
Sometimes, you're better off alone
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't ever wanna be your boyfriend

And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

Pose, you've gotta save your reputation
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't wanna save your reputation

And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice
I am just a villain vying for attention from a girl
A girl who can't decide and here's the reason why

Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh, victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
Oh, the neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And a black tar palm keeps weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights that read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

LA Devotee
LA Devotee

LA Devotee

The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oh-woah
Oh-woah
I wanna go home Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough
(Don't think I'll ever get enough)


Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying ""If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe""
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

It's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright
It's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now
(Don't think I'll ever get it now)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying ""If you go all out you might pass out in a drain pipe""
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down
When the sun came up
I think we've had enough

Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying ""If you go all out you might pass out in a drain pipe""
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time All my life, been hustlin' and
Tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs and
My pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons stocks
And bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave
A climber and a sadist, yeah

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it‚Äôs a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, ‚ÄúHey look ma, I made it‚Äù

Friends are happy for me or
They're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or
They wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while
These other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?

I said, ‚ÄúHey look ma, I made it, I made it‚Äù
I said, ‚ÄúHey look ma, I made it, I made it‚Äù
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

I said, ‚ÄúHey look ma, I made it‚Äù

(Wide awake and dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it)
Hey look ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

I keep searching
Oh, I keep searching
I keep searching The moment you arrived, they built you up
The sun was in your eyes, you couldn't believe it
Riches all around, you're walking
Stars are on the ground, you start to believe it

Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA

Nights at the chateau, trapped in your sunset bungalow
You couldn't escape it, yeah
Drink of paradise, they told you to put your blood on ice
You're not gonna make it

Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

So, I guess we're back to us
Oh, cameraman, swing the focus
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off? (Let's pick up and go)

Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

Dance to this beat, dance to this beat

And hold a lover close

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's gonna find Miss Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles, hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky
Kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life
(No one's gonna find out)

A pretty picture, but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (In your nightgown)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Way down till the fire finally dies out
You've got 'em wrapped around your finger
Watch 'em fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fallout
Let me say it one more time
(Tragic in the fallout)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her any‚Äî

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson
(I love her anyway)

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway Kids, you have to remember I'm up here conducting you for a reason, okay? Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me. One and, two and, three and, ready, go!

D√®s le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants, j'aimerais √™tre comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour, je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...

My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody, my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a

Matching set of marching clocks
The slumbering apparitions that they've come to wake up

Here I am composing a burlesque
Out of where they rest their necks
Sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a girl

You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence, and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!

Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (I've got just one...)
Ahhh... It's these substandard motels on the la-la-la-la-la
Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe
Just a dash of formaldehyde
And a habit of decomposing
Right before your very la-la-la-la eyes

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
A wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah

And not to mention the constable
And his proposition for that ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù
Yes, the one the lawyer met with
On ‚Äústrictly business‚Äù
As he said to the Mrs
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of a different kind

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

There are no
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and the girls in white dresses
And the sleeping with the roaches and the taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things Ode to the old, and to the new
We rededicate this song to you

Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
One more, one more

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Say it one more, one more, one more

Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
One more, one more

We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Quick charade, Beyonc√©, Lemonade
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
No delay, no halfway, let me hear you say
One more, one more, one more

Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top

Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Mona Lisa, wear me out
I'm pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa, wear me out

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don‚Äôt you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page, it‚Äôs chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world‚Äôs a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don‚Äôt you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)

Sugarcane in the easy morning
(Hey moon, please forget to fall down)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Hey moon, don't you go down)
Sugarcane in the easy morning
(You are at the top of my lungs)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Drawn to the ones who never yawn)

(Sugarcane in the easy morning)
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
(Weathervanes my one and lonely)
Hey moon, don't you go down
You are at the top of my lungs
Drawn to the ones who never yawn Ohh!
A moment you'll never remember
And a night you'll never forget!
Ohh!

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it)

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

I was drunk and it didn‚Äôt mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it ohhhhh)

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I‚Äôm sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You‚Äôll never know if you don‚Äôt ever try again
So let‚Äôs try
Let‚Äôs try
Let‚Äôs try

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers You can set yourself on fire, hey!
You can set yourself on fire, hey!

She said, ""At night, in my dreams
You dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh, but when I wake up
You're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight like commuters
With briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer
Inside of your eyes""

She said, ""You're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson""
Said, ""You're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Brian Wilson""

And I said
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)
I'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...

You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
(Hey!)

She said, ""Darlin', you know
How the wine plays tricks on my tongue
But you don't seem to change
When you stuff all of your feelings with drugs""
Other boys you may have dated
Serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts
Baby, it's a sweet butter knife

She said, ""You're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson""
Said, ""You're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Dennis Wilson""

And I said
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)
I'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...

You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
(Hey!)

You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire

And I said
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)
I'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...

You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)
You can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
(Hey!) Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It‚Äôs just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place where we used to say
""Man, it feels good to feel this way""
Now I know what I mean
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place, in your house of memories

Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I think of you from time to time more than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters, I was a fool

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
Then will you remember we in the same way as I remember you?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
In your house of memories
(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
Promise me a place Now I'm of consenting age
To be forgetting you in a cabaret
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's PA
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach and lime daiquiri

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?

Oh, but I'm afraid that I
Well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead
D-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place
Well, I'm afraid that I
Well, that's right, well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

And paying in naivety?
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
Praying for love and paying in naivety
Praying for love and paying in naivety, oh Sit tight, I'm going to need you to keep time
Come on, just snap, snap, snap your fingers for me
Good, good, now we're making some progress
Come on, just tap, tap, tap your toes to the beat

And I believe
This may call for a proper introduction, and well
Don't you see?
I'm the narrator and this is just the prologue

Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives
Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives

Applause, applause, no, wait, wait
Dear studio audience, I've an announcement to make
It seems the artists these days are not who you think
So we'll pick back up on that on another page

And I believe
This may call for a proper introduction, and well
Don't you see?
I'm the narrator and this is just the prologue

Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen

Yeah, there's a couple fracks, but we got it. That's the shit, that's the shit, and, man, I saw you fuckin' lift that sax up towards the microphone and I fell in love!
K, alright, one more time, here we go Please leave all overcoats, canes, and top hats with the doorman
From that moment, you'll be out of place and under-dressed
I'm wrecking this evening already, and loving every minute of it
Ruining this banquet for the mildly inspiring, and...
Please leave all overcoats, canes, and top hats with the doorman
From that moment, you'll be out of place and under-dressed
I'm wrecking this evening already, and loving every minute of it
Ruining this banquet for the mildly inspiring, and...

When you're in black slacks
With accentuating off-white pinstripes, whoa-oh
Everything goes according to plan

I'm the new cancer, never looked better, you can't stand it
Because you say so under your breath
You're reading lips, ""When did he get all confident?""
Haven't you heard that I'm the new cancer?
Never looked better and you can't stand it

Next is a trip to the, the ladies' room in vain, and
I bet you just can't keep up with (Keep up) with these fashionistas
And tonight, tonight, you are, you are a whispering campaign
I bet to them, your name is cheap
I bet to them, you look like sh...
Talk to the mirror, oh, choke back tears
And keep telling yourself that ""I'm a diva!""
Oh, and the smokes in that cigarette box on the table
They just so happen to be laced with nitroglycerin

I'm the new cancer, never looked better, you can't stand it
Because you say so under your breath
You're reading lips, ""When did he get all confident?""
Haven't you heard that I'm the new cancer?
Never looked better and you can't stand it

Haven't you heard that I'm the new cancer?
I've never looked better and you can't stand it
Haven't you heard that I'm the new cancer?
I've never looked better and you can't stand it

And I know, and I know it just doesn't feel like
A night out, with no one sizing you up
I've never been so surreptitious
So, of course, you'll be distracted when I spike the punch
And I know, and I know it just doesn't feel like
A night out, with no one sizing you up
I've never been so surreptitious
So, of course, you'll be distracted when I spike the punch
And I know, and I know it just doesn't feel like
A night out, with no one sizing you up
I've never been so surreptitious
So, of course, you'll be distracted when I spike the punch! I found a pile of Polaroids in the crates of a record shop
They were sexy, sexy looking back from a night that time forgot
(Ooh-oh) Boy, he was something, debonair in 1979
And she had Farrah Fawcett hair, carafes of blood red wine

In the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days

I bet they met some diplomats on Bianca Jagger's new yacht
With their caviar and dead cigars, the air was sauna hot
I bet they never even thought about the glitter dancing on the skin
The decades might've washed it out as the flashes popped like pins

In the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days

Time can never break your heart, but it'll take the pain away
Right now our future's certain, I won't let it fade away

Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days Once upon a thrill, from a kiss to a swill
We were swallowin' the nights like we had nine lives
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so
We were borderline kids with a book of disorders
Medicatin' every day to keep the straightness in order
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

Once upon before, we were brilliant and bored
Two dashes of the bitters, add some ice and you pour
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

Get boozy, boozy, boozy (now it looks like a wasteland)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy (not the way that we remember)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy (one more sip for the past)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy (and always tip your bartenders)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy, Get boozy, boozy, boozy
Get boozy, boozy, boozy, Get boo-

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times The I.V. and your hospital bed
This was no accident, this was a therapeutic chain of events

This is the scent of dead skin on a linoleum floor
This is the scent of quarantine wings in a hospital
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering where
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
And it sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

Just sit back, just sit back
Just sit back and relax
Just sit back, just sit back
Just sit back and relapse again

Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again (Ba-ba-ba-doh)
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back

You're a regular decorated emergency
You're a regular decorated emergency

This is the scent of dead skin on a linoleum floor

It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
The anesthetic never set in and I‚Äôm wondering where
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
It‚Äôs not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again (Ba-ba-ba-doh)
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back

Sit back, sit back, relax, relapse
Sit back, sit back, ba-ba-ba-doh
You can't take the kid out of the fight

You're a regular decorated emergency
The bruises and contusions
Will remind me what you did when you wake
You've earned your place atop the ICU's hall of fame
The camera caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again
You're a regular decorated emergency

You can't take the kid out of the fight

The I.V. and your hospital bed
This was no accident, this was a therapeutic chain of events (I look like Rocky Balboa)

Cross my heart and hope to die
Burn my lungs and curse my eyes
I've lost control and I don't want it back
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

It's better to burn than to fade away
It's better to leave than to be replaced
I'm losing to you, baby, I'm no match
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

Just one more hit and then we're through
'Cause you could never love me back
Cut every tie I have to you
'Cause your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad
Your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad

Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Ah-ah, oh-oh

I can hear you but‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖwon't
Some look for‚ÄÖtrouble
While others don't
There's a thousand reasons
I‚ÄÖshould go about my day
And ignore your whispers
Which I wish would go away, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh

You're not a voice
You're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't
I'm spoken for, I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh, oh-oh

What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?
Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go

Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh, oh-oh (Whoa-oh-oh)

Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you
Into the unknown?
Woo! Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Just for the attention
'Cause that's just ridiculously odd
Well, she sure is gonna get it
Here's the setting, fashion magazines line the walls
Now, the walls line the bullet holes

Have some composure, where is your posture? (Oh, no, no)
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)
Have some composure, where is your posture? (Oh, no, no)
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)

Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!
When I say ""Shotgun,"" you say ""Wedding""
Shotgun wedding! Shotgun wedding!

She didn't choose this role
But she'll play it and make it sincere so
You cry, you cry (Give me a break)
But they believe it from the tears and the teeth
Right down to the blood at her feet
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And wearing Aubergine Dreams (Give me a break)

Have some composure, where is your posture? (Oh, no, no)
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)
Have some composure, where is your posture? (Oh, no, no)
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger (All wrong)

Come on, this is screaming ""photo op,"" come on, come on
This is screaming, this is screaming, this is screaming ""photo op""
Boys will be boys, baby, boys will be boys
Boys will be boys, baby, boys will be boys

Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!
When I say ""Shotgun,"" you say ""Wedding""
Shotgun wedding! Shotgun wedding!

Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And boys will be boys
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And wearing Aubergine Dreams Let me hear you say somethin'

Sorry to get sentimental tonight
(That perfume lingers in your hair)
It's just that everything reminds me of things
I thought I shouldn't have to see again
See, the thing is I'm so sorry to say
(You need me, don't you?)
Someone still loves you (still loves you)
Someone still loves you

Meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna
Let me hear you say somethin'

I have a shirt that keeps your smell
(That perfume lingers in your hair)
You keep one too in parallel
(You keep my long black leather)
See the thing is I'm so sorry to say
(You need me, don't you?)
Someone still loves you (loves you)
Someone still loves you

Tiny bottles of shit wine
In a tin can that climbs
But I remember every time
Everything about you is perfect
Down to your blood type
But I remember every time

Meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys
(Sketchy girls and lipstick boys)
Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna
Let me hear you say somethin' I feel the salty waves come in
I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV
That changes everything I see
And maybe if I continue watching
I'll lose the traits that worry me

Can we fast-forward to go down on me?

Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here

Can we fast-forward 'til you go down on me?

Taking everything for granted
But we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion
Knowing everything is fine (Everything is fine)
And I would wait and watch the hours fall
In a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside

Can we fast-forward 'til you go down on me?

Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
Catch me up on getting out of here

More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you
I know there's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead and watch me go

Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't want to live a life that is comprehensive
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on getting out of here
So catch me up, I'm getting out of here

G-g-go down on me
Can we fast-forward til you go d-d-d-d-down? There's no sunshine, this impossible year
Only black days and sky grey and clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow that won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons, this impossible year

There's no good times, this impossible year
Just a beachfront of bad blood and a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party, they're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude, this impossible year

There's no you and me, this impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow,  the scar's souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise, this impossible year

There's never air to breathe, there's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream...

There's no sunshine...
There's no you and me...
There's no good times...
This impossible year... Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, whoa, whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Truth is that it was always going to end
The symphony buzzing in my head
Took a market of filth and sold like summer
True, all of the good girls act so good
'Til one of them doesn't wait their turn
Turn the memory to stone and carve your shoulder
Hey, holy roller

If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty

I know what it's like to have to trade
The ones that you love for the ones you hate
Don't think I've ever used a day of my education
There's only two ways that these things can go
Good or bad and how was I to know
That all your friends won't hold any grudges
I got the final judgement

If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty

And you been gone so long
I forgot what you feel like
But I'm not gonna think about that right now
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
And all our friends want us to fall in love

If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, whoa whoa oh-oh, whoa oh-oh
The good, the bad, and the dirty Stop stalling, make a name for yourself
Boy, you better put that pen to paper, charm your way out
If you talk, you better walk, you better back your shit up
With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun
Start talking ""a sensationalist""
Oh, he's slightly clever to just a certain extent
If you talk, you better walk, you better keep your mouth shut
With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun

(Panic!, meet the press)
It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us to take a chance

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzine
Make us it, make us hip, make a scene

If you talk, you better walk, you better back your shit up
With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun
Start talking ""a sensationalist""
Oh, he's slightly clever to just a certain extent
Well, keep quiet, let us sing like the doves
Then decide if it's done with purpose or lack thereof

Just for the record, the weather today
Is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
A: indifference, or B: disinterest

I know it sounds awkward, I'm filthy as charged, filthy as charged
You're a sweet talker, but darlin' whatcha gonna say now?
The midnight marauders, the higher never come down, never come down

You can't take me anywhere, anywhere

I've got a few lawyers and you're guilty as charged, guilty as charged
We could be waltzin', yeah

Don't call me Saint California if you're at another altar
Just gimme your vows, gimme your vows, yeah

(If you love me) I was fine, just a guy living on my own
Waiting for the sky to fall
Then you called and changed it all, doll
Velvet lips and the eyes to pull me in
We both know you'd already win
Mmm, your original sin

You fooled me once with your eyes now, honey
You fooled me twice with your lies, and I say

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world so unaware
Does she know that my destiny lies with her
Sarah (Sarah, Sarah, Sarah)
Oh Sarah (Sarah), are you saving me?

Waking up to a kiss and you're on your way
I really hoped that you would stay
But you left and went your own way, babe
I don't mind, take your time, I got things to do
Besides sit around and wait for you
Oh, and I hope you do too

You fooled me once with your eyes now, honey
You fooled me twice with your lies, and I say

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world so unaware
Does she know that my destiny lies with her
Sarah
Oh Sarah, are you saving me?

And it's killing me inside
Consuming all my time, you've left me blind
And when I think I'm right, you strip away my pride
You cast it all aside but I say

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world so unaware
Does she know that my destiny lies with her
Sarah (Sarah)
Oh Sarah (Sarah), are you saving me? Are you worth your weight in gold?
Cause you're behind my eyelids when I'm all alone
Hey, stranger, I want you to catch me like a cold
You and God both got the guns, when you shoot, I think I'd duck

I led the revolution in my bedroom
And I set all the zippers free
We said, ""No more war, no more clothes! Give me peace!
Oh, kiss me!""

Hey! Hey! We are a hurricane, drop our anchors in a storm
Hey! They will never be the same, a fire in a flask to keep us warm
Cause they know, I know that they don't look like me
Oh, they know, I know that they don't sound like me

You'll dance to anything! You'll dance to anything!

Oh, I'd confess, I'd confess in a room where I‚Äôm blessed
But he didn't come and speak to me or put my heart at ease
And I believe that half the time I am a wolf among the sheep
Gnawing at the wool over my eyes

I led the revolution in my bedroom
And I set all the zippers free
We said, ""No more war, no more clothes! Give me peace!
Oh, kiss me!""

Hey! Hey! We are a hurricane, drop our anchors in a storm
Hey! They will never be the same, a fire in a flask to keep us warm
Cause they know, I know that they don't look like me
Oh, they know, I know that they don't sound like me

You'll dance to anything! You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything! You'll dance to anything!

Fix me or conflict me, I'll take anything
Fix me or just conflict me, cause I'll take anything

Hey! Hey! We are a hurricane, drop our anchors in a storm
Hey! They will never be the same, a fire in a flask to keep us warm
Cause they know, I know that they don't look like me
Oh, they know, I know that they don't sound like me

You'll dance to anything! You'll dance to anything! Give us this day, our daily dose of faux affliction
Forgive our sins, forged at the pulpit
With forked tongues selling faux sermons
'Cause I am a new wave gospel sharp, and you'll be thy witness
So gentlemen, if you're gonna preach
For God sakes, preach with conviction

Strike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, let's sing it like you mean it, no
Don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move
Strike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, let's sing it like you mean it, no
Don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move

Just stay where I can see you, douse the lights!
We sure are in for a show, tonight

In this little number, we're graced by two displays of character
We've got the gunslinger extraordinaire, a walking contradiction
And I, for one, can see no blood
From the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit
And I, for one, won't stand for this
If this scene were a parish, you'd all be condemned

Strike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, let's sing it like you mean it, no
Don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move
Strike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, let's sing it like you mean it, no
Don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you, don't you move

Just stay where I can see you, douse the lights
We sure are in for a show, tonight!
Just stay where I can see you, douse the lights!
We sure are in for a show, tonight!
Stay where I can see you, douse the lights!

Strike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, let's sing it like you mean it no
Don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move
Strike up the band! Whoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, let's sing it like you mean it, no
Don't you get it? Don't you get it? Now, don't you move
Don't you move, don't you move... strike up the band! Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows Things are shaping up to be pretty odd
Little deaths in musical beds
So it seems I‚Äôm someone I've never met
You will only hear these elegant crimes
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth

And everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I‚Äôm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I want to go where everyone goes
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same
I never said I‚Äôd leave the city
I never said I‚Äôd leave this town
A falling out we won‚Äôt tiptoe about

Well, everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I‚Äôm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, and I say

Things have changed for me (Well, things have changed for me)
And that's okay (Come on, everybody, let's dance and sing)
I feel the same (I'm singing it all night long)
And I say (Come on, everybody, yeah, join along, I'm singing)
Things have changed for me (Well, things have changed for me)
And that's okay (Come on, everyone, let's dance and sing)
I feel the same (I'm singing it all night long)
And I say (Come on, everybody, yeah, sing along)
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I'm on my way and I say

Things have changed for me Looks innocent enough, doesn't it?
But sometimes, there are dangers involved
That never meet the eye
No matter where you meet a stranger
Be careful if they are too friendly

Hey, a casual affair
That could go anywhere
And only for tonight
Take any moment, any time
A lover on the left
A sinner on the right

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush-hush, baby, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair

Break involuntary ties
A secret so the spies
Could never find us out
Stay for as long as you have time
So the mess that we'll become
Leaves something to talk about

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush-hush, baby, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair

(I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it again)

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush-hush, baby, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair I never so adored you
I'm twisting allegories now
I want to complicate you
Don't let me do this to myself

I'm chasing roller coasters
I've got to have you closer now
Endless romantic stories
You never could control me

Well, I never really thought that you'd come tonight
While the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die
We're far too young to die
Far too young to die

Fixation or psychosis?
Devoted to neurosis now
Endless romantic stories
You never could control me

Well, I never really thought that you'd come tonight
While the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die
Well, I never really thought that you'd come tonight
While the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die
We're far too young to die
Far too young to die

Well, I never really thought that you'd come tonight
While the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die
We're far too young to die
Far too young to die Whether near or far
I am always yours
Any change in time
We are young again

Lay us down
We're in love
Lay us down
We're in love

In these coming years
Many things will change
But the way I feel
Will remain the same

Lay us down
We're in love
Lay us down
We're in love Watch your mouth, oh, oh, oh
Because your speech is slurred enough
That you just might swallow your tongue
I'm sure you would want to give up the ghost
With just a little more poise than that
Or was it God who chokes in these situations
Running late? Oh no, he called in
Or was it God who chokes in these situations
Running late? Oh no, he called in

The hospice is
A relaxing weekend getaway where you're a cut above all the rest
Sick and sad patients on first name basis
With all the top physicians

Prescribed pills
To offset the shakes, to offset the pills
You know you should
Take it a day at a time

That's when you st-st-stutter something profound
To the support on the line
And with the way you've been talking
Every word gets you a step closer to hell
That's when you st-st-stutter something profound
To the support on the line
And with the way you've been talking
Every word gets you a step closer to hell

Prescribed pills
To offset the shakes, to offset the pills
You know you should
Take it a day at a time
Prescribed pills
To offset the shakes, to offset the pills
You know you should
Take it a day at a time

I am
Alone in this bed, house, and head
And she never fixes this
But at least she
I am
Alone in this bed, ooh
She never fixes this
But at least she

Prescribed pills
To offset the shakes, to offset the pills
You know you should
Take it a day at a time

The hospice is
A relaxing weekend getaway where you're a cut above all the rest
Sick and sad patients on first name basis
With all the top physicians We've waited so damn long, we're sick and tired
I won't leave any doubt or stone unturned
I've got a collar full of chemistry from your company
So maybe tonight, I'll be the libertine

Oh, show me your love (your love), your love (your love)
Give me more but it's not enough (your love)
Show me your love (your love), your love (your love)
Before the world catches up (your love)
'Cause there's always time for second guesses
I don't want to know
If you're gonna be the death of me
That's how I want to go

You've got it all worked out with so little time
Memories that I'd black out if you were mine
You've got a pocket full of reasons why you're here tonight
So, baby, tonight just be the death of me

Oh, show me your love (your love), your love (your love)
Give me more but it's not enough (your love)
Show me your love (your love), your love (your love)
Before the world catches up (your love)
'Cause there's always time for second guesses
I don't want to know
If you're gonna be the death of me
That's how I want to go

Oh show me your love, your love
Give me more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up

Show me your love (your love), your love (your love)
Gimme more but it's not enough (your love)
Show me your love (your love), your love (your love)
Before the world catches up (your love)
Show me your love
Show me your love When the world gets too heavy
Put it on my back, I'll be your levy
You are taking me apart
Like bad glue on a get well card

It was always you falling for me
Now there's always time calling for me
I'm the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

I'm a fly that's trapped in a web
But I'm thinking that my spider's dead
Lonely, lonely little life
I could kid myself in thinking that I'm fine

It was always you falling for me
Now there's always time calling for me
I'm the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

That I'm skin and bone
Just a king and a rusty throne
Oh, the castle's under siege
But the sign outside says, ""Leave me alone""

It was always you falling for me
Now there's always time calling for me
I'm the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

It was always you
Blink back to let me know
It was always you... She held the world upon a string
But she didn't ever hold me
Spun the stars on her fingernails
But it never made her happy
'Cause she couldn't ever have me
She said she'd won the world at a carnival
But she could never win me
'Cause she couldn't ever catch me

I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes, I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well, I just see the sky

I don't love you, I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me? I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea to see if I can catch a dream

The sun was always in her eyes
She didn't even see me
But that girl had so much love
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time
She said she'd won the world at a carnival
But I'm sure I didn't ruin her
It just made her more interesting
I'm sure I didn't ruin her
Just made her more interesting

I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes, I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well, I just see the sky

I don't love you, I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me? I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea to see if I can catch a dream Placing a smile at the perfect event
Gracing your skin with the side of my hand
If I ever leave, I could learn to miss you
But ""Sentimental Boy"" is my nom de plume

Let me save you, hold this rope

I may never sleep tonight (Sleep tonight...)
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
So, I'll stay awake till I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away

I feel marooned in this body
Deserted, my organs can go on without me
You can't fly these wings (Fly these wings)
You can't sleep in this box with me

Let me save you, hold this rope

I may never sleep tonight (Never sleep tonight...)
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
So, I'll stay awake till I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away

So, let me save you, hold this rope
And I'll pull you in, 'cause I am an anchor
Save her or feel it sinking in
Let me save you, hold this rope
(This is only the greatest story every told)
I am an anchor, sinking her
(With lightning in my head to be brought to the world)

I may never sleep tonight (Never sleep tonight...)
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
So, I'll stay awake till I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer
When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
(Summer, summer, summer, summer)
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, ""Would it be alright
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?""
So she said, ""That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone, in the summer""

Well, he was just hanging around, then he fell in love
And he didn't know how, but he couldn't get out
Just hanging around, then he fell in love

In the middle of summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
(Summer, summer, summer, summer)

When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

(Summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of...) One, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh!
Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh!

Oh, if you only knew
What we've been up to
I guarantee you'd keep it secret
So give it to me now
We're lost in a dream now
Do it (five, four, three, two) one more time

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning till the curtain's coming down

Ain't it so, ain't it so perfect?
Our cynical minds will make it totally worth it
So give it to me now
We're lost in a dream now
Do it (five, four, three, two) one more time

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning till the curtain's coming down

Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh!
Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh!

And we're all not here for nothing
And we're bored with looking good
We gotta be starting something
Would you change it if you could?
And we're all not here for nothing
(Would you change it if you could?)
And we're bored with looking good
(Would you change it if you could?)
We gotta be starting something
(Would you change it if you could?)
Would you change it if you could?

In the Vegas lights

The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown

Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one! Whoa-oh!
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one! Whoa-oh!
We're winning till the curtain's coming down If I retreat
Words, wars, and symphonies
Make room! We're taking over here
And you're the galantine
Cold and alone, it suits you well
Won't find me perching here again

May your feet serve you well
And the rest be sent to hell
Where they always have belonged
Cold hearts brew colder songs
Fate will play us out
With a song of pure romance
So, stomp your feet and clap your hands

Let's kill tonight! Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight! Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!

May your feet serve you well
And the rest be sent to hell
Where they always have belonged

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... A daydream spills from my corked head
Breaks free of my wooden neck
Left to nod over sleeping waves
Like bobbing bait for bathing cod
Floating flocks of candled swans
Slowly drift across wax ponds

The men all played along to marching drums
And, boy, did they have fun, behind the sea
They sang, (Hey!) so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to God
Yes, we're all too smart to talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch
Sprouting suns and ageless daughters

Don't you know, don't you know
That those watermelon smiles
Just can't ripen underwater?
Just can't ripen underwater?

The men all played along to marching drums
And, boy, did they have fun, behind the sea
They sang, (Hey!)
So our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to God
Yeah, we're all too smart to talk to God
Oh, we're all too smart to talk to God

Oh, legs of wood waves
Waves of wooden legs (Yeah!)
Waves of wooden legs
Legs of wood waves
Waves of wooden legs
Waves of wooden legs
Legs of wood waves
Waves of wooden legs
Waves of wooden legs
Legs of wood waves
Waves of wooden legs
Waves of wooden legs

So close... He was the congregation's vagrant
With an unrequited love
When your passion's exaltation
Then finding refuge is not enough
She was the youngest of the family
And the last to be let go
When they decided they would try
And make it on their own

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Where'd you go?

When July became December
Their affection fought the cold
But they couldn't quite remember
What inspired them to go
And it was beautifully depressing
Like A Streetcar Named Desire
They were fighting for their love
That had started growing tired

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Don't fade away


When the money lost momentum
And the bills were piling high
Then the smile had finally faded
From the apple of their eye
They were young and independent
And they thought they had it planned
Should've known right from the start
You can't predict the end

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Don't fade away! (Whoa)
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for (Whoa)
You‚Äôve been searchin' in the dark
Your sweat soakin' through the floor (Whoa)
And buried in your bones, there‚Äôs an ache that you can't ignore
Takin' your breath, stealing your mind
And all that was real is left behind

Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don‚Äôt care what comes after
Your fever dream, can‚Äôt you see it gettin' closer?
Just surrender ‚Äôcause you feel the feelin' takin' over
It's fire, it‚Äôs freedom, it's floodin' open
It's the preacher in the pulpit and your blind devotion
There's somethin' breakin' at the brick of every wall
It's holdin' all that you know, so tell me do you wanna go?

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

(Whoa)
Colossal we come these renegades in the ring (Whoa)
Where the lost get found, and we crown 'em the circus kings

Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
It's blindin', outshinin' anything that you know
Just surrender 'cause you're callin' and you wanna go

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, intoxicating you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the walls can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show It's getting late, and I
Cannot seem to find my way home tonight
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole
Falling for forever, wonderfully wondering alone

What would my head be like, if not for my shoulders
Or without your smile? May it follow you forever

May it never leave you to sleep in the snow
May we stay lost on our way home

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

If I should die tonight
May I first just say I'm sorry, for I
Never felt like anybody, I am a man of many hats
Although I never mastered anything
When I am ten feet tall
I never felt much smaller
Since the fall, nobody seems to know my name

So don't leave me to sleep all alone
May we stay lost on our way home!

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate
It could leave, it could leave, come the morning
Celebrate the night, it's the fall before the climb
Shall we sing, shall we sing, 'til the morning?
If I fall forward, you fall flat
And if the sun should lift me up, would you come back?
C'mon!
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
So c'mon (Oh), c'mon (Oh), with everything falling down around me  (Falling down around me)
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities (Believe)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

It's getting late, and I
Cannot seem to find my way home tonight Oh... Oh...
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh

You've got these little things that you've been running from
You either love it or I guess you don't
You're such a pretty thing to be running from anyone
A vision with nowhere to go

So tell me right now, ya think you're ready for it?
I wanna know why you got me going
So let's go! We'll take it outta here
I think I'm ready to leap, I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
Get me out of my mind, get me out of my mind
I'm ready to go
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh

You've got these little things; you wanted something for 'em
You'll either get it or I guess you won't
What does it really mean to get nothing from anyone?
There's a million ways it could go

So tell me right now, ya think you're ready for it?
I wanna know why you got me going
So let's go! We'll take it outta here
I think I'm ready to leap, I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
Get me out of my mind, get me out of my mind
I'm ready to go
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh

I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know I'm ready, I know
I think I'm ready, I think
I know

I'm ready to go
Get me out of my mind, get me out of my mind
I'm ready to go
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
I'm ready to go
(I think I'm ready, I think; I know I'm ready, I know)
Get me out of my mind, get me out of my mind
I'm ready to go
(I think I'm ready, I think; I know I'm ready, I know)
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
I'm ready to go
(I think I'm ready, I think; I know I'm ready, I know)
Get me out of my mind, get me out of my mind
I'm ready to go
(I think I'm ready, I think; I know I'm ready, I know)
Oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh

A pocket full of fancy words, a pocket full of fancy words... I'm a disappearing act done poorly
But if I ever get it right, you‚Äôll miss me sorely
Look like the cat that just ate the canary
Coughing up feathers
There's a ""get out of jail"" card
If I can think of something clever

""I plead the Fifth
On all of this""

When your chips are down
And your drinks are all gone
I'll still be here
Wishing and waiting for you to come on
Kaleidoscope eyes sparkle at the world
My emerald city downtown girl
In the sickness of you
I‚Äôm just a white blood cell, fighting like hell for you

Oh, I‚Äôm just a crook, with no intent or stash
Pour gasoline on the vault, just to burn the cash
I swear to God
I‚Äôve never heard a better sound (coming out)
Than when you‚Äôre whimpering my name
From your mouth

""I plead the Fifth
On all of this""

When your chips are down
And your drinks are all gone
I'll still be here
Wishing and waiting for you to come on
Kaleidoscope eyes sparkle at the world
My emerald city downtown girl
In the sickness of you
I‚Äôm just a white blood cell, fighting like hell for you
I've got an insatiable desire for your insides
It's undeniable
I'll conspire in full
Against your body tonight

When your chips are down
And your drinks are all gone
I'll still be here
Wishing and waiting for you to come on
Kaleidoscope eyes sparkle at the world
My emerald city downtown girl
In the sickness of you
I‚Äôm just a white blood cell, fighting like hell for you

Come on, you can do this, you're so st...
Come on, don't get, don't get yourself down
You got this, pace yourself, pace yourself... I'm just setting, I'm just setting a trap
And I'm not pulling, no, I'm not pulling for you
You're just pulling at me, I'm not a betting man
But this is a sure thing, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bada-ba

I've been to Tokyo and to South Africa
So many places (woo!), that you might say I've seen it all
But my favorite place is the warm embrace
Of holding your hair back in a bathroom stall

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Everything I do is bittersweet
You could tell me secrets that I'll probably repeat
I'm not trying to hurt you, I just love to speak
It feels like we're pulling teeth, so bittersweet (Woo-hoo-hoo!)

I guess that is how it's got to be
I guess that is how it's got to be

All that hate is gonna burn you up
It keeps me warm at night, warmer than anyone
I think how many drinks I've had, no more in either hand
I'm slurring on purpose, and it's certainly worth it, oh, oh

Everything I do is bittersweet
You could tell me secrets that I'll probably repeat
I'm not trying to hurt you, I just love to speak
It feels like we're pulling teeth, so bittersweet (Woo-hoo-hoo!)

I guess that is how it's got to be
I guess that is how it's got to be
I guess that is how it's got to be

You and me, another proverbial tree
It's such a mystery why you're here (But I can't live without you)
And you became as clear as cellophane
My voice of reasoning
I don't think I can take the way
You make me out to be

I'm just setting, I'm just setting a trap
And I'm not pulling, no, I'm not pulling for you (Woo!)

Everything I do is bittersweet
You could tell me secrets that I'll probably repeat
I'm not trying to hurt you, I just love to speak
It feels like we're pulling teeth, so bittersweet
It feels like we're pulling teeth, so bittersweet
It feels like we're pulling teeth, so bittersweet
(Ba-ba-ba-bitter, bitter all the time) Come save me from walking off a window sill
Or I'll sleep in the rain
Don't you remember when I was a bird
And you were a map?
And now he drags down miles in America
Briefcase in hand
The stove is creeping up his spine again
Can't get enough trash

He took the days for pageant, and became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits, who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?

His arms were the branches of a Christmas tree
Preached the devil in the belfry
He checked in to learn his clothes had been thieved
At the train station
The rope hung his other branch and at the end
Was a dog called Bambi
Who was chewing on his parliaments
When he tried to save the calendar business
He tried to save the calendar business

He took the days for pageant, and became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits, who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?

The poor son of a humble chimney sweep
Fell to a cheap crowd
So stay asleep and put on that cursive type
You know we live in a toy
You know that Paul Cates bought himself a trumpet
From the Salvation Army
But there ain't no sunshine in his song
We must reinvent love, reinvent love, reinvent love

He took the days for pageant, and became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits, who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?
We must reinvent love, reinvent love, reinvent love Clouds are marching along
Singing a song, just like they do
If the clouds were singing a song
I'd sing along, wouldn't you, too?
If you just knew what they could do
Oh, if you just knew, what would they do?

And if the birds are just hollow words
Flying along, singing a song
What would they do
If they just knew what they could do?
Oh, if they just knew

I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

I know it's mad, but if I go to hell
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad, but if the world were ending
Would you kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?

Clouds are singing a song
Marching along, just like they do
If the clouds were playing a song
I'd play along, wouldn't you, too?
If you just knew what they could do
Oh, if you just knew, what would they do?

And if words are just hollow birds
Flying along, singing a song
What would they do
If they just knew what we could do?
Oh, if they just knew

I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

I know it's mad, but if I go to hell (I know it's mad)
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad, but if the world were ending (I know it's mad)
Would you kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?

I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me (I know it's sad)
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me (I know it's oh so sad)
No, it never gave a damn about me (Oh so sad) Only for you, only for you

They said, ""If you don't let it out, you're gonna let it eat you away""
I'd rather be a cannibal, baby, animals like me don't talk anyway
Feel like an ambulance, chaser of faith
Pray I could replace her, forget the way her tears taste
Oh, the way her tears taste

Put another X on the calendar, summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life, but only for you, only for you

The world may call it a second chance
But when I came back it was more of a relapse
Anticipation's on the other line
And obsession called while you were out
Yeah, it called while you were out

Put another ex on the calendar, summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life, but only for you, only for you

Asleep in the hive, I guess all the buzzing got to me
Well, I am still alive, at night your body is a symphony
And I am conducting...


They said, ""If you don't let it out, you're gonna let it eat you away""

Put another ex on the calendar, summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life, but only for you, only for you

Only for you, only for you, yeah!
Only for you, only for you, only for you, only for you, yeah! (Go on)

Innocence sunk the glow and drowned in covers
Send for all your absent lover's things
Sheepish wolves looking lived-in, eating buttons
Wink, just don't put your teeth on me
(Go on)

Accidents let the evening in the back door
Filled the room, ceiling to the floor
Beat backbones grazed the poem and made it strange
I wasn't born to be a skeleton
(Go on)

Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
(Go on)

Jealous orchard, the sky is falling off the ceiling
While I'm tucking fibs into a cookie jar
Reverie, it's useless searching in the cupboards
When everything you have is on your back
(Go on)

Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
(Go on) Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
(Go on) Film the world before it happens
Film the world before it happens
(Go on) Film the world before it happens Drop every pretense
Drown every sense you own
For the girl that you love
Girl you loathe
Insistent pretext
So what does that make God
To the girl that you love?
Girl you loathe

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't

Denominations
Surrender all control (All control)
To the girl that you love (Girl that you love)
All control
Our indignation
To every tainted soul (Tainted soul)
And the girl you love (Girl you love)
All control (All control)

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't

Followed her, followed her
Followed her, followed her home

Girl that you love
Girl that you love You remind me of a former love
That I once knew
And you carry a little piece with you
We were holding hands walking through
The middle of the street, it's fine with me
I'm just taking in the scenery

You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends

Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
Yeah, we're splashing around
And the news spread all over town
I'm not complaining that it's raining
I'm just saying that I'd like it a lot more than you'd think
If the sun would come out and sing with me

You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends

Hey moon!
Hey moon! Hey moon, hey moon
Hey moon! Hey moon, hey moon
Hey moon! Hey moon, hey moon I got so sick of being on my own
Now the devil won't leave me alone
It's almost like I've found a friend
Who's in it for the bitter end
Our consciences are always so much heavier
Than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time?

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart, my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I've got
Like the man I know I'm not

So sick of wasting all my time
How in God's name did I survive?
(How did I survive?) I need a little sympathy
Disarm my insecurities
Our consciences are always so much heavier
Than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time?

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart, my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I've got
Like the man I know I'm not
(Oh, oh, oh)

A heavy heart on the boulevard tonight, oh
Shooting stars, watch me fall apart tonight
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart, my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I've got
Like the man I know I'm not

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh... This is gospel
For the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling
Their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories
Oo-ooh-oh-oh-oooh
Oo-ooh-oh-oh-oooh

The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
Cause these words are knives
That often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

This is gospel
For the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing
Their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors
Oo-ooh-oh-oh-oooh
Oo-ooh-oh-oh-oooh

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
Bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
Cause these words are knives
That often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

The fear of falling apart
The fear, the fear of falling apart
The fear of falling apart
The fear of falling apart
The fear of falling apart
The fear of falling apart Oh, little did she know
Couldn't let me go, already a part of her
So often do I meet people in between
That just can't get a hold of it

So we'll just sing it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just sing it for them
(Just can't get a hold of it)
So we'll just sing it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just sing it

It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there

Slow, leave walking to the world
Give your feet a chance, they'll do all the thinking
Toast high until they find less pathetic wine
Until they get a better blend

Then we'll just drink it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just drink it for them
('Til they get a better blend)
So we'll just drink it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just drink it

It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there
It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there She don't leave make-up after her kiss
All the boys at night think that she's theirs
All the secrets that you keep
Might get spoken while you sleep

And all the boys and I
All the boys and I
Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I too (Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true?

Closer now and closer still
Dance closer to her till she knows you're there
And all our secrets that you keep
Might get spoken while you sleep

And all the boys and I
All the boys and I
Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I too (Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true?

She came here to entertain you
You'll fall hard into her charm

All the boys and I
All the boys and I
Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I too (Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true?
All the boys and I
All the boys and I
Love her madly
All the boys and I
All the girls and I too (Oh, oh!)
Picture girls we want so badly
Isn't she a dream come true? Fall to your knees and kiss the ring
The crowds rejoice in
All of my dreams
Wake up to despise a world I once loved
Why would you bring me in
If you knew what you'd become?
So curse everyone and everything
Even the sun

Stall me, stall me, I'm all in
Stall me, call me up or break me in
A dark room in the wallflower garden of the party
She's got four on the floor, she's waiting to kickstart me
So just stall me

I had a rosy dream
You gave up on you and I gave up on me
Well, love came along and said
""Leave them be"" (Ah-oh-oh-oh...)
We were wrecked on every rock, you tasted
Like cork, my pretty little angel
I'm singing to empty bottles everywhere
Everywhere

Stall me, stall me, I'm all in
Stall me, call me up or break me in
A dark room in the wallflower garden of the party
She's got four on the floor, she's waiting to kickstart me
So just stall me!

She counts on stars, astrology
My moods are mercurial, but I'm no mercury
Don't hold your breath
Baptized in the river of you
Hold on death
The moon's just a sliver of you

Stall me, stall me, I'm all in
Stall me, call me up or break me in
A dark room in the wallflower garden of the party
Stall me, stall me, I'm all in
Stall me, call me up or break me in
A dark room in the wallflower garden of the party
She's got four on the floor, she's waiting to kickstart me
She says she's got more
Where that came from to spark me
So just stall me! Whoo! I won't cut my beard and I won't change my hair
It grows like fancy flowers, but it grows nowhere
My hair, my hair
If I could build my house just like the Trojan horse
I'd put a statue of myself upon the shelf
Of course, of course, of course

She's the smoke, she's dancing fancy pirouettes
Swan diving off of the deep end of my tragic cigarette
She's steam laughing on the windowpanes
The never-ending, swaying haze
Oh, that ever smiling maze
Oh, that ever smiling maze...
A ballet

Everything's gone missing, I've lost more songs to floods
I can't prove this makes any sense, but I sure hope that it does
Perhaps, I was born with curiosity, the likes of those of old crows
The likes of those of old crows, and oh, how the piano knows
The piano knows something I don't know

I won't cut my beard and I won't change my hair
It grows like fancy flowers, but it grows nowhere
My hair, my hair
If I could build my house just like the Trojan horse
I'd put a statue of myself upon the shelf
Of course, of course, of course Santa, baby, please be fast
Joy to the world and all that jazz
It's a wonderful life to be happy with the people you love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So fix the shining star for all to see
Fire up the mistletoe and light the tree
Ain't no feeling like this, that can get you like the holiday bug
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
So hang the pretty stockings by the chimney with care
And lay right by the fire, there's a nip to the air
And celebrate the holiday with presents to spare, oh yeah

And now it feels like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
It's like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you, yeah

Hark the herald angel sings
Just hopin' Santa brings her a wedding ring
There's some beautiful things that she could show 'em off whenever she wants
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget about the heartache, there's so much to be shared
A million invitations and I'm gonna prepare
And celebrate the holiday with presents to spare
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

And now it feels like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
It's like Christmas, nearly every day
It's like Christmas, we're like children playing
On Christmas, every step of the way
When I'm with you, when I'm with you

Now it feels like Christmas
Oh, it feels like Christmas
Feels like Christmas
Now it feels like Christmas
Yeah, it feels like Christmas
Oh, it feels like Christmas
Yeah, it feels like Christmas
Now it feels like Christmas
Feels like Christmas Lying there with a halo in her hair, she cried
""There are feathers everywhere, but it's fine
You do this all the time""
Crying now through a rusted smile, she knows
This isn't how he paid the bills, before
Drug farm entrepreneur

Go spin circles for me
Wound relentlessly around the words we used to sling
Oh, such torturous things
Always chewing up the only ones I ever mean

If you're going, then go
Go, go, go
If you're going, then go
Go, go, go

Watch love get strangled by a kite's cold strings
Fall comes early and summer leaves
As a storm with the car keys
Spark your heels up against the picket fence I built
All your wishes, they will sink like stones
Slowly down a lonely well

Go spin circles for me
Wound relentlessly around the words we used to sling
Oh, such torturous things
Always chewing up the only ones I ever mean

If you're going, then go
Go, go, go
If you're going, then go
Go, go, go Allow me to exaggerate a memory or two
Where summers lasted longer than, longer than we do
When nothing really mattered except for me to be with you
But in time, we all forgot and we all grew

Your melody sounds as sweet as the first time it was sung
With a little bit more character for show
And by the time your father's heard of all the wrong you've done
Then I'm putting out the lantern, find your own way back home

If I'd forgotten how to sing before I'd sung this song
I'll write it all across the wall before my job is done
And I'll even have the courtesy of admitting I was wrong
As the final words before I'm dead and gone

You've never been so divine in accepting your defeat
And I've never been more scared to be alone
If love is not enough to put my enemies to sleep
Then I'm putting out the lantern, find your own way back home I can only hope it's true enough
That every little thing I do for love
Redeems me from the moments
I‚Äôve deemed worthy of the worst things that I've done
And saves me from myself in times of envy
When I'm missing everyone

If I wake in the morning
I only need two more miracles to be a saint
Everything I promised everyone I'd be
Well, I just ain't

Lately, it seems like everybody's sick
Everybody's dying (Everybody‚Äôs dying)
Build myself a wall of unhappy highs
And only my heart knows my head is lying, lying
Oh, glory, I think I see you 'round the bend
And I think I try any poison to get there in the end
Oh, glory! (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

When I'm looking past the silken sheets
Take a breath to notice I'm between
Every little piece of threaded memories
That constitutes your dreams

If I wake in the morning
I only need two more miracles to be a saint
Everything I promised everyone I'd be
Well, I just ain't

Lately, it seems like everybody's sick
Everybody's dying (Everybody‚Äôs dying)
Build myself a wall of unhappy highs
And only my heart knows my head is lying, lying
Oh, glory, I think I see you 'round the bend
And I think I try any poison to get there in the end
Oh, glory! (Whoo!)

Oh, glory, I think I see you 'round the bend
And I think I try any poison to get there in the end
Oh, glory, I think I see you 'round the bend
And I think I try any poison to get there in the end

Lately, it seems like everybody's sick
Everybody's dying (Everybody‚Äôs dying)
Build myself a wall of unhappy highs
And only my heart knows my head is lying, lying
Oh, glory, I think I see you 'round the bend
And I think I try any poison to get there in the end
Oh, glory, I think I see you 'round the bend
And I think I try any poison to get there in the end
Oh, glory! Oh, glory! Oh, glory! Is there a heart inside the night?
I can feel its vital signs
The beat goes dry and the spirit dies
Oh, I wanna dig this Tinseltown
Till it's six feet underground
It's safe to say, timing is everything (Is everything)

I wanna be free
I wanna be loved
I wanna be more than you're thinking of
Everything seems to be estranged when you're alone

Played our parts and covered ground
Drowned our sorrows, laid 'em down
My memory is keeping the effigy (The effigy)

I wanna be free
I wanna be loved
I wanna be more than you're thinking of
Everything seems to be estranged when you're alone

One day, I will stop keeping track
(Is it me? Is it you?)
And give myself time to react
One day... One day...

I wanna be free
I wanna be loved
I wanna be more than you're thinking of
Everything seems to be estranged when you're alone
Wanna be free
Wanna be loved
Wanna be more than you're thinking of
Everything seems to be estranged when you're alone
Oh, yeah! Here we come!

Oh, how it's been so long, we're so sorry we've been gone
We were busy writing songs for you
Oh, how it's been so long, we're so sorry we've been gone
We were busy writing songs for

You don't have to worry 'cause we're still the same
We're still the same band
You don't have to worry, you don't have to worry, you don't
You don't have to worry, you don't have to worry, you don't

Oh, how it's been so long, we're so sorry we've been gone
We were busy writing songs for you... (Niemieckich spotka≈Ço siƒô z szerokim rozg≈Çosem w samych)
Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly present a picturesque score of passing fantasy Moving forward, using all my breath
""I'll make it up to you"" is all I should have said
Mom and Dad looked me right between the eyes
Then I awoke, a blinding light

Can't fight against the youth (Hey)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Though I had the thoughts, no one ever heard them right
Fought resistance nearly my entire life
Then I awoke, a blinding light

Can't fight against the youth (Hey)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't fight against the youth (Hey)
You'll never take us alive
Can't fight against the youth (Hey)

Never going to take us, never going to break us

‚ÄúHey mister!‚Äù the bellman says
‚ÄúI can only recall and spend some time,"" I said
So he replies, ‚ÄúAnd how do you manage?‚Äù
I dodge the blast, and apologize for collateral damage

In love, I've always been a mercenary, but I never leave my post when the cash runs out
I want to make you quiver
Make your backbone shiver
Hey kid, take the stage and deliver

‚ÄúHey mister!‚Äù the bellman says
‚ÄúI can only recall and spend some time,"" I said
So he replies, ‚ÄúAnd how do you manage?‚Äù
I dodge the blast, and apologize for collateral damage (collateral damage, collateral damage)

‚ÄúHow does it feel to stand on the very stones that ran with your parent‚Äôs blood?
Do you feel sad? Full of rage? Or does that outfit help you bury your feelings?
Hiding your true self
You‚Äôre truly an extraordinary specimen, I look forward to breaking you‚Äù
I dodge the blast, and apologize for collateral damage

It's almost Halloween
All my friends are wondering
What they're going to be
The ""Monster Mash"" is playing
You're moving to the beat
And now we're going to teach you
To do the trick or treat

Everybody scream
Everybody scream
It's almost Halloween
Do the trick or treat
Do the trick or treat
It's almost Halloween
Everybody scream

There's a devil in the corner
In candy apple red
Dressed up like a fire
Burning through my head
I got a little closer
And offered her a drink
Who took me to the graveyard
And we did the trick or treat

Everybody scream
Everybody scream
It's only Halloween
Do the trick or treat
Do the trick or treat
It's only Halloween
Everybody scream

Before I learned her name
We were already asleep
When I woke up in my coffin
She was nowhere to be seen
Was it all a dream
Who can I believe
It can't be what it seems
It was only Halloween
What does it all mean

Everybody scream
Everybody scream
It was Halloween
Do the trick or treat
Do the trick or treat
It was only Halloween
Everybody scream

Everybody scream
Everybody scream
It was Halloween
Do the trick or treat
Do the trick or treat
It was only Halloween
Everybody scream Here I am composing a burlesque out of where they rest their
Necks, sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a boy

I eat my wishes on golden toothpicks and digested them with
Wolf intestines

I fell from the heavens as a fetish blessed with
An operatic skeleton
And as the stars watch me descend, I crack a family tree and
Chopped off all of the branches
I fell from the heavens as a fetish blessed with
An operatic skeleton
And as the stars watch me descend, I crack a family tree and
Chopped off all of the branches
Get familiar! Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue our broadcast of dance music. We shall continue now with our piano interlude I have crickets living with me
Little chirping limbs are coaxing
Me to see you can‚Äôt be lonely
When crickets live inside your clothing
Crickets living in my coat sleeves
Little chirping limbs are coaxing
Me to see I must be lucky
To have you be the one
Who loves me
I suppose if there were no reason
It wouldn‚Äôt be my coat they sing in
Because crickets hold no intent
Of being loved or being lucky
And I am both from what you've shown
So feather fingers if I am truly
Made of one million glowing constellations
Then I think I owe it to you to
Try to be every hallucination
You see in me
Thank you feather fingers for
Believing there is more out
Here than what we‚Äôre seeing
That there is more than just a canvas ceiling
Hanging above our heads with no meaning
For reminding me the sun will come
Just when we think it has given up
And that it truly is enough
To be alive and be in love
For being the reason the birds
Keep singing and for being
What the sky‚Äôs been needing
What you see in me are just hallucinations
I know it‚Äôs you who are the glowing constellations
I‚Äôm only reflecting your perfections
I know I‚Äôm lucky, feather fingers Jesus loves me more than he

Loves you
And Jesus is in love with everything I do
When I touch myself every day
Jesus' love comes shining through
'Cause Jesus loves me more than he loves you

A man, with muscles of steel
And his love is just as real Sit tight, I'm going to need you to keep time
Come on, just snap, snap, snap your fingers for me
Good, good, now we're making some progress
Come on, just tap, tap, tap your toes to the beat
And I believe this may call for a proper introduction, and well
Don't you see? I'm the narrator, and this is just the prologue
Swear to shake it up, if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives
Swear to shake it up, if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be your eyes

This is the scent of dead skin on a linoleum floor
This is the scent of quarantine wings in a hospital
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering where
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
No it's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
And it sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
You're a regular decorated emergency
You're a regular decorated emergency
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back
Sit back, sit back, relax, relapse
Sit back, sit back, woah
Can't take the kid out of the fight
The I.V. and your hospital bed
This was no accident
This was a therapeutic chain of events

Now I'm of consenting age
To be forgetting you in a cabaret somewhere
Downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song
On the club's P.A
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach and lime daiquiri
And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance, oh
But, but I'm afraid that I
Well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead
D-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place
Well, I'm afraid that I
That's right
Well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

Is worth so much more than a diamond ring

In separate ways

No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
""What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!‚Äù, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
""And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a shhh""

I chimed in with a
""Haven't you people ever heard of closing the g**damn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chimed in

No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

Well, in fact

I mean technically our marriage is saved
Well this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne

This, our town of Halloween

This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night

This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
Trick or treat until the neighbors going to die of fright
It's our town, everybody scream
In this town of Halloween

I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair


In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
Round that corner, man hiding in the trash can
Something's waiting now to pounce, and how you'll
Scream! This is Halloween
Red and black, slimy green
Aren't you scared?
Well, that's just fine
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night


I am the clown with the tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the ""who"" when you call, ""Who's there?""
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright



Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin
This is Halloween, everybody scream
Won't you please make way for a very special guy
Our man jack is King of the Pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now

Whoo! A very short backstory: my parents had this thing called chore day
Every Saturday you clean the house, and I was the youngest of five siblings so I would get shit detail. I would clean the toilet most of the time --- that's okay, that's alright, look at me now, bro! Haha, I still clean his toilet, it's alright. Uh, anyways, my parents, they would make us clean the house, but the good thing, the saving grace, was that they would play records all the time. They'd play Journey, Phil Collins, oh my god, it was just ridiculous. But there was one guy, one guy who caught my ear at a very young age. His name was Billy Joel. Now, this man, this man is a legend, a god among men. We're gonna do this song. One, two, three, four!

Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said ""Sonny, move out to the country""
But workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money

And it seems such a waste of time
Well that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
Ooh, oh oh, ooh

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Oh and he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

And if that's what you had in mind
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Oh, movin' out
Ooh, oh oh, ooh

You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money

And it seems such a waste of time
Yeah, but that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Oh, movin' out, haha
Ooh, oh oh, ooh

I'm movin' out
I am
I'm movin' out
Oh yeah
Oh I feel as if I‚Äôm a figurine
I feel like something on strings
Posed by love's fragile fingers
And possessed by a frantic
Fluttering in my chest
I am renewed. I am not of
Rags or of scraps. Pristine‚Ä¶
(I am something velveteen)
And I'll be like something velveteen
The charcoal clouds have finally
Finished spitting on me
Concentrating instead on painting a
Faithful portrait splashed across
The canvas of the wine read heavens
You are draped across a vast daffodil cream ...Around, around
Around, around

Why does it take the sun
Flyin' a million miles
To get as close as we could ever be
And turn right back around, around
Around, around

Hey, I'm alright!
Nothing's wrong and I don't need any help
No, it's not okay
I'm fine, but you do this to yourself
Okay, you got your way
I'm not wasting any time on this
I'll be waiting at the start of your life
When you turn it back around
Around (when you turn it back around)
Around, around

If I had the nerve
To pick up the phone
Just to hear the words behind the slurs
I'll turn this back around, around

Hey, I'm alright
Nothing's wrong and I don't need any help
No, It's not okay, I'm fine
But you do this to yourself
Okay, you got your way
I'm not wasting any time on this
I'll be waiting at the start of your life
When you turn it back around
Around (When you turn it back)
Around (When you turn it back)
Around
Around (It doesn't matter what you say or think)
Around (When the words are faked with ?)
Around (What were left, what were left, what were left)
Around (Who'd you be? Who'd you be? Who'd you be?)

What is it gonna take
To make your car break down
And realize mistake's repairable
You can turn it back around, around
Around, around

Hey, I'm alright
Nothing's wrong and I don't need any help
No, It's not okay, I'm fine
But you do this to yourself
Okay, you got your way
I'm not wasting any time on this

When you turn it back around
Around (When you turn it back)
Around (When you turn it back)

Around (It doesn't matter what you say or think)
Around (When the words are faked with ?)
Around (What were left, what were left, what were left?)
Around (Who'd you be? Who'd you be? Who'd you be?) After disaster
Where do we go?
Tearing our minds up and turning to stone
Break through the water
Born to be wild
Run 'til your lungs burn and you with fire
And there's something inside I have yet to discover
Oh
I will give up this right 'til I got what I came for
Oh

And even if the clouds crash down around us
Or if the ground falls out beneath
I'll take a hold of all your colors
Until they start to bleed

My bloody valentine
My my my

My bloody valentine

I'll take my chances with the devil tonight
But I'm running out of time
If this is wrong
I don't want to be right
Let the fantasy die
'Cause I'm not who you thought I would be
You dropped your love
Now you're waiting on me
Let's take it over while we're still young
Never felt so alive

And even if the clouds fall down around us
Or if the ground falls out beneath
I'll take a hold of all your colors
Until they start to bleed

My bloody valentine

My bloody valentine Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Just for the attention
'Cause that's just ridiculously odd
Well, she sure is gonna get it
Here's the setting
Fashion magazines line the walls, now
The walls line the bullet holes

You sure, you sure you let her have it
You sure, you sure you...

Have some composure, where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger
All wrong
Have some composure, where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger
All wrong

Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break
When I say ""Shotgun"", you say ""Wedding""
""Shotgun"", ""Wedding"", ""Shotgun"", ""Wedding""

Well, she didn't choose this role
But she'll play it and make it sincere
So you cry, you cry
(Baby, give me a break)
But they believe it from the tears and the teeth
Right down to the blood at her feet
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And wearing Aubergine dreams
(Baby, give me a break, break, break, break)

Have some composure, where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger
All wrong
Have some composure, where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger

Come on, this is screaming ""Photo op, op""

When I say ""Shotgun"", you say ""Wedding""

Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And boys will be boys
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And wearing Aubergine dreams She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In a pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Want to try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime


Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Might solve a mystery, or rewrite history!

Duck Tales (woo oo)
Every day they're out there making
Duck Tales (woo oo)
Derring-tales in all bad and good
Luck tales

D-D-D-Danger, lurks behind you
There's a stranger out to find you
What to do? Just grab on to some

Duck Tales (woo oo)
Everyday they're out there making
Duck Tales (woo oo)
Tales of derring-do, bad and good
Duck Tales (woo oo)
Not pony tails or cottontails
No, Duck Tales (woo oo) ...scratched my phosphorus skin... Watch your mouth
Your speech is slurred enough
That you might swallow your tongue
You'd want to give up the ghost
With just a little more poise than that
Or was it God who chokes
In these situations, running late, no, no
He called in, he called in

A relaxing weekend getaway
Where you're a cut above all the rest
Sick and sad patients
On first name basis with all the top physicians

The men all played along to marching drums
And boy did they have fun, behind the sea
They sang, so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to God, yes, we're all too smart to talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs to us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak, through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch, sprouting suns and ageless daughters
Those watermelon smiles just can't ripen underwater, just can't ripen underwater

The men all played along to marching drums

The camera caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again
You're a regular decorated emergency
The bruises and contusions will remind me what you did when you wake
You've earned your place atop the ICU's hall of fame
The camera caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again

Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back

You can take the kid from the fight, can't take the fight from the kid
(Just sit back)
Can't take the kid from the fight, can't take the fight from the kid
(Just sit back, just sit back
Just sit back, just sit back)

The I.V. and your hospital bed
This was no accident
This was a therapeutic chain of events You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck Karma police
Arrest this man, he talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge, he's like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl, her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill and we have crashed her party

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

Karma police
I've given all I can, it's not enough
I've given all I can, but were still on the payroll

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you fuck with us

And for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Shit! For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

I'm afraid that I...
I'm afraid that I...
Well I'm afraid that I
I lost myself
I lost myself She held the world upon a string
But she didn't ever hold me
Spun the stars on her fingernails
But it never made her happy
Cause she couldn't ever have me
She said she won the world at a carnival
But she couldn't ever win me
'Cause she couldn't ever catch me

I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes
I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well I, just see the sky

I don‚Äôt love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throw an old line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream

The sun was always in her eyes
She didn't even see me
But that girl had so much love
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time
She said she won the world at a carnival
But I'm sure it didn‚Äôt ruin her
Just made her more interesting
I'm sure it didn‚Äôt ruin her
Just made her more interesting

I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes
I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well I, I just see the sky

I don‚Äôt love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throw an old line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea out in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer
When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
While her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
In the middle of summer
In the middle of summer (oh oh oh oh)

Well, he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
And he fell in love

In the middle of summer
In the middle of summer (oh oh oh oh)

When the Moon fell in love with the Sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
So he said, ""Would it be alright
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?""
So she said, ""Hey, that's okay
As long as you can make a promise not to break
My little heart and
Leave me all alone in the summer""

Dreamed this dream when seventeen
In a garden under green umbrella trees
While we dreamed through the wildest dreams
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
In the middle of summer
In the middle of summer (oh oh oh oh)

When the moon fell in love with the sun Scarlet's talking, sinking every last ship in the harbor Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High hopes)

Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had high, high hopes (High hopes)
Woo

Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling (Woo)
Always had a, always had a feeling
Al-Al-Al-had, always had a feeling (Woo)
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

(Always had a, always had a feeling

Always had a, always had a feeling
Always had high, high hopes)

There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
No!


Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry
Don't you cry no more

No more! Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah we're feeling so good
Pickin‚Äô up things we shouldn‚Äôt read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It‚Äôs just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place
Where we used to say
Man it feels good to feel this way
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon Clouds are marching along, singing a song,  just like they do
If the clouds were singing a song I'd sing along, wouldn't you too?
If you just knew, what they could do
Oh, if you just knew, what would they do?
And if birds are just hollow words flying along, singing a song
What would they do?
If they just knew, what they could do
Oh, if they just knew

I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

I know it's mad
But if I go to hell
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad
But if the world were ending
Would you just kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?

Clouds are singing a song, marching along, just like they do
If the clouds were playing a song I'd play along, wouldn't you too?
If you just knew, what they could do
Oh, if you just knew, what would they do?
And if words are just hollow birds flying along, singing a song
What would they do?
If they just knew, what we could do
Oh, if they just knew

I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

I know it's mad
But if I go to hell

Just leave me?

That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know its sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know its sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me I won't cut my beard and I won't change my hair
It grows like fancy flowers but it grows nowhere
My hair, my hair
If I could build my house just like the Trojan horse
I‚Äôd put a statue of myself upon the shelf, of course, of course
Of course
Of course, of course
Of course
Of course, of course
Of course
Of course, of course
Of course
Of course
Genius please let me change this (Oh no...)

I... have a con- Thank you, Zack. I have a confession to make: you guys are my pilates, ok? This is the best workout I've ever had in my life.‚Äã Wooh! And I still get to drink beer, that's amazing.‚Äã That's the best workout of the world, I'm glad this isn't international.‚Äã
I think that's Gatorade.‚Äã
That isn't that (?), is that what you said?
No, it's Gatorade.‚Äã
...Oh shit, woops. Well I'm wrong... again. Alright! So how many the people in the house that haven't seen Animal House (a classic), thank God! Thank God! Alright! If you're willing, right now, get down to knee level, like , like this. If you're down.‚Äã You don't have to do it, I'll probably be the only one, it's okay, it's not the first time. Then you're down like this and the next two minutes, it's gonna get fucking crazy, and what I mean by fucking crazy is you have to move, dance, scream or whatever you want to do, alright? If you don't wanna dance and you're like ""Oh, I'm not a dancer"", that's bullshit and I'll be telling you, I'm gonna show you three dances right now, one is right here, you just go side to side. People will say that's not a dance move but fuck them because that's an awesome dance move. If you don't want to do that : like this. And if that's not your bag, you just do this: it's a little two step from back in the day. Alright! Spencer, please bring us back here.‚Äã

Without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change the less you feel

Believe
Believe in me
Believe
That life can change
That you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same
We're different

Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, so bright
Tonight (tonight)

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade
In your city by the lake
The place where Jon was born

Believe
Believe in me
Believe
In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance tonight

Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, so bright

We'll crucify the insincere tonight (tonight)
We'll make things right
We'll feel it all tonight (tonight)

The indescribable moments of your life tonight
The impossible is possible tonight
Believe in me as I believe in you
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight... You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof glass

You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium Everytime that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way, everybody got the dues in life to pay
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away

And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I make a picture

Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie?

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you

Are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair
Are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine
You were dodging all the time
Are you still dizzy?

Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie?

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I make a picture

Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie? Sit tight, I'm gonna need you to keep time
Come on, just snap-snap-snap your fingers for me

You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Look what you've done
I‚Äôm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Let a man brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy (High, high hopes)
Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said (Mama said)
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
Always had high, high hopes
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said
It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me, eh, eh, eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see, eh, eh, eh
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
(High, high hopes)
Always had high, high hopes If all our life is but a dream
Fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don‚Äôt you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weather vanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page
It‚Äôs chasing off the days
Look back at both feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn
That fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world‚Äôs a broken bone
But melt your headaches call it home



Sugarcane in the easy morning
(You are at the top of my lungs)
Weather vanes my one and lonely
(Drawn to the ones who never yawn)


Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
You are at the top of my lungs
Drawn to the ones who never yawn She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me


You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long All I know is I don't wanna be the only one
This time, I don't wanna be the only one
This time, I don't wanna be the only one, this time

Oh God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle

In pouring white and browns
It seeped into the gray
No I know that I don't want to be the only one
This time, I don't want to be the only one
This time, I don't want to be the only one
This time

Oh, God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle
Oh, God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle

You can pick me up
Show me where I stand
Now the train is up
And I'm not so good with driving
It's a million miles
To the nearest cell
It's inside my head
And please for now
Forget about me

Oh, God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle
Oh, God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle
(Oh, God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle
Oh, God, pick me up I'm
Not so good with problems
Everybody's up
Everybody's down
Everywhere I go
Stuck in the middle The ink is running toward the page, it‚Äôs chasing off the days

(Haha!) Here I am
The new administration, the new administration
(What!) H-h-here I am, here
The new administration, the new administration
Here, here I am, here
The new administration, the new administration
(Oh!) Here, here I am, here I, here I
The new administration, the new administration
Here I am
The new administration, the new administration
Here, here I am, here
The new administration, the new administration
(Y'all ready!) Here, here I am, here
The new administration, the new administration
(Let's go!) Here I-here I-here I- Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates

Well Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
It's like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house
Takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions but we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands

Ohhh
Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning
She says ""it's only in my head""
She says ""Shhh! I know it's only in my head""
She said ""did you think that you were dreaming?""
I said ""no""
""Did you think that you were dreaming""
I said ""no""
""Did you think that you were dreaming""
I said ""sometimes I don't know""
There's a girl on the car out in the parking lot
And she says ""come on, ya know come on just take a shot
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
Can't you see my walls are tumbling down?
Can't you see my walls are crumbling down?
Can't you see my sun stop spinning around
Can't you see the sky turn black and brown
Can't you see the moon is flashing round
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
No
There's a girl on the car out in the parking lot
Says ""Man, you should try to take a shot
""Can't you see my walls are crumbling down?""
Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

Round here she's always on my mind
Round here, hey man, got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early and nobody makes us wait
Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late

I can't see nothing, nothing round here
So will you catch if I'm falling
Will you catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun round here
Man I said I'm under the gun round here
But I can't see nothing
Nothing round here Miss Jones taught me English
But I think I just shot her son
'Cause he owed me money
With a bullet in the chest you cannot run
Now he's bleeding in a vacant lot
The one in the summer where we used to smoke pot
I guess I didn't mean it
But man, you should've seen it
His flesh explode
Slow motion, see me let go
We tend to die young
Slow motion, see me let go
What a brother knows
Slow motion, see me let go
Now the cops will get me
But girl, if you would let me
I'll take your pants off
I got a little bit of blow we could both get off
Later bathing in the afterglow
Two lines of coke I cut with Drano
And her nose starts to bleed
A most beautiful ruby red
Slow motion, see me let go
Remember these days
Slow motion, see me let go
Urban life decays
Slow motion, see me let go
At home
My sister's eating paint chips again
Maybe that's why she's insane
I shut the door to her moaning
And I shoot smack in my veins
Wouldn't you
See my neighbor's beating his wife
Because he hates his life
There's an knock to his fist as he sways
Oh man, what a beautiful thing
And death slides close to me
Won't grow old to be
A junkie wino creep
Hollywood glamorized my wrath
I'm a young urban psychopath
I incite murder for your entertainment
'Cause I needed the money
What's your excuse
The joke's on you
Slow motion, see me let go
Oh yeah
Slow motion, see me let go
Slow motion, see me let go
Oh yeah There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship  bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat I pulled into Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need to find a place where I can lay my head
""Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?""
He just grinned and then he shook my hand, and ""No!"", was all he said

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie, And (and) (and)
You put the load right on me (you put the load right on me)

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, ""Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown.""
She said, ""Baby, I've got to go, but my friend the devil can stick around.""


Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing that you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke is waiting on the Judgement Day
""Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"" (Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)

You have got these little things
That you have been running from
You either love them or I guess you do not
You are such a pretty thing
To be running from anyone
A vision with nowhere to go

So tell me right now
You think you are ready for it
I want to know
Why you got me going
So let us go
We will take it out of here
I think I am ready to leap
I am ready to live

I am ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I am ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)

You have got these little things
You wanted something for them
You either get it or I guess you will not
What does it really mean
To get nothing from anyone?
There is a million ways it could go

So tell me right now
You think you're ready for it
I wanna know
Why you got me going
So let's go
We'll take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leap
I'm ready to live

I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)

I think I'm ready I think
I know I'm ready I know
I think I'm ready I think
I know I'm ready I know
I think I'm ready I think
I know I'm ready I know
I think I'm ready I think
I know
 
I'm ready to go
(Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind)
I'm ready to go
(Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh) Close your eyes
Dream alone
When you arise
You will be home

Close your eyes
Dream alone
When you arise
You will be home

Take a chance at something comin' in
Everyone will win
Take a chance at something comin' in
Everyone is already away
(I can't think straight)
Take a chance at something comin' in
Everyone will win
(I feel like we can win)

Close your eyes
Dream alone
When you arise
You will be home
Close your eyes
Dream alone
When you arise
You will be home

Take a chance at something comin' in
Everyone is already away
(I feel like I can't think straight)
Take a chance at something comin' in
Everyone will win I feel the salty waves come in
I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV
Changes everything I see
Maybe if I continue watching
I'll lose the traits that worry me

Can we fast-forward to go down on me

Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here

Taking everything for granted but we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine (Everything is fine)
And I would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside



More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you
I know there's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead and watch me go


It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't want to live a life that was comprehensive
Because seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on getting out of here
So catch me up I'm getting out of here

         They said ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt let it out
You‚Äôre gonna let it eat you away'
I‚Äôd rather be a cannibal, baby
Animals like me don‚Äôt talk anyway
Feel like an ambulance
Chaser of faith
Pray I could replace her
Forget the way her tears taste
Oh, the way her tears taste

Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse
Than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you

The world may call it a second chance
But when I came back it was more the relapse
Anticipation's on the other line
And an obsession called while you were out
Yeah, it called while you were out

Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse
Than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you

Asleep in the hive
I guess all the buzzing got to me
Well, I am still alive
At night your body is a symphony
And I am conducting

It is said if you do not let it out
You are going to let it eat you away

Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on its deathbed
There is simply nothing worse
Than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you *Please note that Covers and Demos do not count

And every single fight's alright, alright, alright, alright,‚ÄÖalright

You‚ÄÖput a sour‚ÄÖlittle flavor in my mouth now
You‚ÄÖmove in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

Hey, maybe we can try again tomorrow morning
Hey, rotten to the core
Bad apple's gonna give it all away
Rotten to the core
Bad apple's gonna give it all away

Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out)

Hey, maybe we can try again tomorrow morning
Hey, rotten to the core
Bad apple's gonna give it all away
Rotten to the core
Bad apple's gonna give it all away

Every single night's alright
Every single night's a fight
And every single fight's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
(Gonna give it all away)

Rotten to the core
Bad apple's gonna give it all away Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah we're feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It‚Äôs just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be and we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

Because it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place where we used to say
""Man, it feels good to feel this way""
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

Because it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon High, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million

Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes) Sing it to the skies
I ain't ever gonna lie (To you)
And I really wanna try
But‚ÄÖthere's‚ÄÖno, there's no
There's‚ÄÖno way we're gonna die

When i‚ÄÖwas young
I didn't know how long (How long, how long)
It took for plants to grow
But now that I roll (I roll, I roll)
I've come to know

And patience is a virtue
My mama told me to
Wait, wait, wait
And good things would come

Sing it to the skies
I ain't ever gonna lie (To you)
And I really wanna try
But there's no, there's no
There's no way we're gonna die

A sunny day you came by
Your eyes bright, tip of a blunt
Your curves filled up my glass
Cheers to all! (Sing it!)

Patience was a virtue (Yeah it was)
My mama ain't ever lie to me
Days and nights, they all go by
But you ain't ever gonna leave my side

Sing it to the skies
I ain't ever gonna lie (Yo you)
And I really wanna try
But there's no, there's no
There's no way we're gonna die

And when the Detroit moonlight is stolen
And it all seems like it's falling
You and I, we'll keep on calling
Calling to the heavens (Sing it!)

Sing it to the skies
I ain't ever gonna lie (No, never)
And I really wanna try (We won't die)
But there's no, there's no
There's no way we're gonna die

No, we won't die (Under the moonlight)
No, we won't die (Sing it to the skies)
No, we won't die (Swear it, swear it)
No, we won't die Lyrics Oh, if you only knew what we‚Äôve been up to
Perverse and oh so masochistic
So get down on your knees now, and swallow the key down
We‚Äôre f-u-c-k-i-n-g now

It‚Äôs a showbiz town
The dirty little secrets
No reason left to keep them if there‚Äôs no one else around
We don‚Äôt deserve to go to heaven
All attention
Prolong the intersession ‚Äòtill the curtain‚Äôs coming down

Introvert
Inside the city
Shake the plague, take the cur–µ
Make pathosis look pretty
Get down on your knees now, and swallow th–µ key down
We‚Äôre f-u-c-k-i-n-g now

And we‚Äôll all die here for nothing
And we‚Äôre bored with looking good
We are vain, and oh so charming
Would you change it if you could?"
