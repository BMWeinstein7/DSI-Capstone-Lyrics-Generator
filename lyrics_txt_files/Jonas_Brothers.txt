Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, oh

He said, I've been to the year 3000 (Yeah, yeah)
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, doing fine

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
Days lifted in a haze, we weren't just a phase
We weren't just pretend (Just pretend)

I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

Faith led me to the clouds, reaching for the ground
'Cause life was upside down
Now everything has changed, we found better days
But I still hear the sound

I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

Woo-ooh-ooh (Yeah, with you)
Woo-ooh (With you, with you)
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster

Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless
Baby, can't you see?

Now I'm!
Yeah, oh!

Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

Oh, lovebug again I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Come on, girl

I fell (I fell) so fast (So fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels), red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh
Staring me down, I know you feel it, too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Yo, we're burning up in this place tonight
Your Brothers sing it loud (And we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (Don't try and fight it)
Big Rob's for real (And that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (And touch the floor)
(It keeps on burnin' up) more and more
I got JB with me (Laying it down)
Come on boys, let’s bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under (Yeah)
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter? (Come on, man)
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Burnin' up (Sup?), burnin' up for you, baby Pardon my interruption
This drink's just settling in
All my reservations
A reason I don't exist
She says, ""Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know it's a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon.""

No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells, wedding bells, wedding bells

Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if I'm being honest
I'm hoping that I'd get caught
Showing you I'm unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June

No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white

Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, ""It’s no surprise we ain't strangers""
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain't strangers
Strangers tonight

Strangers (strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight

You say my name like it's been on your lips
Familiar in ways I can't explain
You got a heart that I know I can miss
Hold me like that and pull me right back again

Time stands still and it's only us
What we feel started way before we ever touched
Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, ""It’s no surprise we ain’t strangers""
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain’t strangers
Strangers tonight

Strangers  (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight

I came here looking for another excuse
To run away from something beautiful
It's like it's driving me closer to you
Every step back pulls me right back

I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, ""It's no surprise we ain’t strangers""
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain't strangers
Strangers tonight

Strangers  (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight Take pictures out of all the frames
Pack up your love with all your things
See if it helps, give it a week
I bet no one else gets you like me

'Cause I know you think you’re better off without me now
Sayin' all you need is space
But baby, we can work this out

But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don’t throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away

Don’t save the words ’til it's too late
I know it hurts and that’s okay
If it's too much to open up, then give it time
I see it in your eyes so let's sleep on it tonight

'Cause I know you think you’re better off without me now
Sayin' all you need is space
But baby, we can work this out

But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don't throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away

Take your time-time, take your time, don't throw it away
Take your time-time, don't throw it away, yeah
Take your time-time, take your time, don't throw it away, yeah
Take your time-time, don't throw it away

But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don't throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don't throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations

Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication

Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI

Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah

Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get Oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side

When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go

When you look me in the eyes (Yeah)
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright (It's alright)
When you're right here by my side (By my side)
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
Oh, I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, yeah When I look at old stuff, lookin' like it’s over
Lookin' like I'm never going to be that again
Crying over old loves even though they’re over
Never gonna stay friends, yeah, stay friends

They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm
They think I'm happy
They think I’m happy when I’m sad
They think I'm happy
They think I’m happy when I'm

Can't look how we made it, say ""Congratulations""
Lookin' like I’ll never be lonely again
See me in the mirror, nothin' ever changes
Never see the sunset, only in my head

They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm

Never gonna stop, never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop
They think I'm happy when I'm
Never gonna stop, never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop, no
They think I'm happy when I'm

I put on a smile, don't need a face-lift
Why can't I when everybody fakes it?
Well, they think I'm happy
Like they know exactly how I feel
It ain't real, but they still think

They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm

Never gonna stop (I try), never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop
They think I'm happy when I'm
Never gonna stop, never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop, no
They think I'm happy when I'm I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

Lately, I don't think I even know me
Every time you come around, I'm like the old me, old me
Take me back to when you were my only
Well, we were thicker than thieves, like a pod, two peas

And all at once, it's like I'm being someone else, yeah
You're all I want, but I know that you're bad for my health

I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
Doing things I never do, acting like a damn fool
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

I know that I'm better off without you
But I know that I could never live without you, 'out you
Thinkin' 'bout my lips upon your mouth, yeah
Got me weak in the knees, my God, can't breathe

And all at once (All at once)
It's like I'm being someone else (I can be your someone else)
All I want (All I want)
I know that you're bad for my health (Oh no, no)

I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Without you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you
(When I'm around you, baby)

I don't trust, I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself, yeah
I don't trust, I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Around you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you Give me five more minutes
Baby, I'm not finished loving you
I don’t wanna end it when we're only just beginning
Give me five more minutes
Aw yeah

Right now, you just look too good to me (Mmm)
I cannot fathom letting you leave
You've got important places to be (Mmm-mmm)
Just please, not yet
Please, not yet

Give me five more minutes (Yeah)
Baby, I’m not finished loving you
I don't wanna end it when we're only just beginning
Give me five more minutes
Ooh yeah, ooh

(Wait)
Do you think you could just wait a while? (Mmm-mmm)
I think I could make it worth your while (Mmm-mmm)
I know that bein' late ain't your style
But, please say, ""Yes""
Please say, ""Yes""

Give me five more minutes (Hey, yeah baby)
Baby, I'm not finished loving you
I don't wanna end it when we're only just beginning
Give me five more minutes (Just five more)
Aw yeah (Come on), ooh

Please say, ""Yes""
Please say, ""Yes""
Please say, ""Yes, yes, yes"" (Oh)
Please say, ""Yes""
Please say
Please say, ""Yes""

Give me five more minutes
Five more minutes holding you
Baby, I’m not finished and we’re only just beginning
Give me five more minutes We weren't meant to get out of Jersey
Two stops past the parkway
And that old cemetery
We weren’t born to grow in a hurry
But it rained hard in the garden state
And we shot up like weeds
Walking out of that red brick house
Yeah I could hear it screaming
""Please don't leave""

Like ""Hey, where you goin'?
Don’t you want to talk about it
Before you walk away?""
Like ""Hey, where you goin'?
When there's still
So much left to say""

Hollywood's a lot like the Bible
Both take faith and if you want grace
Then you gotta believe
Holding on was always a battle
Even the father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
Don't always agree
There was always room for one of us
But not enough for three
So who its gonna be?

Saying ""Hey, where you goin'?
Don't you want to talk about it
Before you walk away""
Like ""Hey, where you goin'? (where you goin’?)
When there’s still
So much left to say""

To each other
If we're broken
Rather be honest than unspoken
Words they can hurt but
What could be worse
Than that final curtain come down

Like hey, where you goin’?
Don't you want to talk about it
Before you walk away
Like hey, where you goin'?
When there's still
So much left
Still so much left
Still so much left to say Dum-dum-dum-dum

There's snow on the ground, love in the air
Sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm, the angels are singin'

And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year

You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

Look at the lights
Twinklin' bright 24/7
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white
This could be heaven

And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year, yeah (woo!)

You make every day feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)

Every day that I'm with you Yeah

She said, ""I wanna find somebody by nightfall""
Ooh-na-na, could it be ya

You're the kind of person to put yourself first, yeah

La la la la la la la la, la la la la la (first) Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay a little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

All this time goes by, still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
Waiting on a cure, but none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know, no, no
Yeah

But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, yeah, oh
You don't even know, no, no

So I'll wait 'til kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be fine Oh, yeah, alright, hmm

Gather 'round, guys, it's time to start listening
Practice makes perfect, but perfect's not working
There's a lot more to music
Than knowing where your cue's gonna be
You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you're moving me

But if you can jump like David Lee Roth
Or pump your fist like you're Bruce ""The Boss""

If you've got heart and soul
You can rock and roll
Rock and roll

Strum it, drum it, slide across and run it
The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the greats did
There's no way that you can fake it
You've got to feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes

Making mistakes, but that won't matter
If you can swagger like 'ol Mick Jagger

If you've got heart and soul
You can rock and roll
You can rock and roll
(Whew, solo)

If you live and you die for the music inside
If the one-four-five never gets sold
Then you can rock and roll, rock and roll

Alright, now, take it slow
Now, I need the spotlight to hit right here
As the crowd starts to cheer
I need the fan to blow right through my rockstar hair
Right here

If you can scream like Axl Rose
Or sing like Xtina show after show

If you've got heart and soul
You can rock and roll, yeah
If you've got heart and soul
You can rock and roll
You can rock and roll
Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah (Rock and roll)
You can rock and roll Oh girl, I'd never change a thing about you
I fell in love with the way that you move
Got me eyeing all the things that you do
Make me never wanna leave the bedroom

Ain't nobody in the world does it like you do
Got me begging you for more yeah it's nothing new
Before you came around yeah I was feeling blue
So tell me if you're down I'll fly you to the moon

Just say I got the greenlight (Light)
The things we do past midnight (Night)
Just me and you and it feels right (Feels right)
Just an empty room and a greenlight
A greenlight (greenlight)

Thinking back to the night we met
Like a song that you can't forget
In this light it's a perfect view
Make me never wanna leave the bedroom

Ain't nobody in the world does it like you do
Got me begging you for more yeah it's nothing new
Before you came around yeah I was feeling blue
So tell me if you're down I'll fly you to the moon

Just say I got the greenlight (Light)
The things we do past midnight (Night)
Just me and you and it feels right (Feels right)
Just an empty room and a greenlight
A greenlight
Just say I got the greenlight (Light)
The things we do past midnight (Things we do)
Just me and you and it feels right (Feels right)
Just an empty room and a greenlight
A greenlight

Greenlight
Greenlight, greenlight
Let me see your body move in the greenlight
Yeah, in the greenlight
I see your body move in the greenlight
Oh-oh-oh

Just say I got the greenlight (Light)
The things we do past midnight (Past midnight)
Just me and you and it feels right (Feels right)
Just an empty room and a greenlight
The greenlight (The greenlight)
Just say I got the greenlight (Light)
The things we do past midnight (What we do)
Just me and you and it feels right (Feels right)
Just an empty room and a greenlight (Hey)
A greenlight

I see your body move in the greenlight
Yeah, in the greenlight
I see your body move in the greenlight, mm If time was still
The sun would never, never find us
We could light up
The sky, tonight
I, could see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly with me?
Oh, yeah
Gotta fly with me now

Now, the past
Has come
And I've been given meaning
And a reason
To give, all I can
To believe, once again

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
That'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So, won't you fly with me?

Maybe you were just afraid
Knowing you were miles away
From the place where you needed to be
And that's right here with me

It's you and me forever
You and me right now
I'd be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So, won't you fly with me?

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
So won't you fly

Fly
Fly, with me? I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freaking out
It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freaking out

Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
I'm paranoid
Yeah!

I take the necessary steps
To get some air into my chest
I'm taking all the doctor's meds
I'm still freaking out
That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid (I must be paranoid)
And I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

Stuck in a room of staring faces, yeah!
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry
Running through the streets
I'm about to freak
Come and rescue me

Just might be paranoid (Might be paranoid)
I'm avoiding the lines, 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise? (Can someone stop the noise?)
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head
Oh, I must be paranoid (Must be paranoid)
I never thought it would come to this

When we heard a funny noise
Opened the backdoor to find out
It was a dude with a British voice
Stood there, said his name was James Corden
And we hadn't heard of him

He told me he built a time machine
Described all the things he'd seen, yeah
And he said:

""I've been to the year 2019
You won't believe who the new President is
It's the guy who hosts ""The Apprentice""
And it's pretty weird, super weird""

He showed us the future through the portal
And we saw everything
Spider-Man, and another one, and another one
And another one
Found out there's a mascot called Gritty
He made us terrified

We thought the future would be the best
So what's new with Kanye West? Yeah (Uhhh...)
He said:

""I've been to the year 2019
TV has changed, now it's all on your cell phone
You can filter any photo
Look! I'm a dog, a sexy dog""

I took a trip to 2019
Twitter sucks, Instagram is thriving
Everybody's wearing really tight jeans
You'll be married (That's surprising)
I took a trip to 2019
So many brand-new milks we're trying:
Cashew, almond, flax milk, oat milk
Rice milk, soy milk, hemp, and goat milk
I took a trip to 2019
Lonely Kevin's still the best meme
Everybody is obsessed with flossing

He said that Blockbuster is shut down
And Apple makes watches now, yeah
I've been to the year 2019
Fyre Fest was a total disaster
And The Rock is now a big actor
Box office champ, Dwayne Johnson (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I said:

""I've been to the year 2019
There's dogs on planes, for emotional reasons
The Kardashians have had 15 seasons
They're everywhere, we're keeping up
I've been to the year 2019
Some things have changed, but it still can get better
And our band is back together and doing fine, doing fine"" (Music) Turn on that radio
As loud as it can go
Wanna dance until my feet can't feel the ground (Feel the ground)
Say goodbye to all my fears
One good song, they disappear
And nothin' in the world can bring me down (Bring me down)

Hand-clappin', hip-shakin', heart-breakin'
There's no fakin' what you feel
When you're right at home, yeah (Yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
Woo!

(Music)
Got my six-string on my back
Don't need anything but that
Everything I want is here with me (Here with me)
So forget that fancy car
I don't need to go that far
What's drivin' me is following my dreams, yeah

Hand-clappin', earth-shakin', heart-breakin'
There's no fakin' what you feel
When you're on a roll, yeah (Yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
I just wanna play my music

Can't imagine what it'd be like (What it'd be like)

Without the sounds of all my heroes singin' all my favorite songs

So I can sing along

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day

And every night
It's the one thing on my mind

Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music all night long

Yeah! Yeah
Whoa

No, this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are

We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here, but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

I'm tryna keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm

Yeah
Like I did before the storm We don’t have time left to regret (Hold on)
It will take more than common sense (Hold on)
So stop your wondering, take a stand (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

One single smile, a helping hand (Hold on)
It's not that hard to be a friend (Hold on)
So don’t give up, stand till the end (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

When it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don’t forget to hold on, hold on

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on I woke up on my roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll

You've got moves, I've got shoes, let's go dancing
Pop and lock, battle dance against Hanson
If we lose, all the girls, they'll be laughing
Where would we be, if we couldn't dream?

And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think
So, call us freaks, but that's just the way we roll

'Cause we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
'Cause that's just the way we roll

And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free, we are more than you think

S Club 7 and all those boy bands
Now it's been a few years
It looks like things have changed
Now she's mine and I wanna say

Thinking and she's always on my mind
And now, I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

When I have a problem

When everything's crazy
She's always there for me

'Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes

Since my phone's rung
And you've been on that line
I've been missing you
It's true

But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah, tonight, I'm gonna fly
Oh yeah
'Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes Tonight, I walked into the bedroom
You were visibly upset
Telling me I made a bad move
But I didn't do nothing
You start screaming, wake the neighbors
Now everybody's out for blood
I didn't want no confrontation
'Cause of you, that's what I've got

Well, you gotta chill out 'cause baby, I don't wanna fight with you
And every battle that we fought just made us look like fools

No, you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III

Now, you're rounding up your army
Turning all your troops on me
Telling lies just to feel happy
But I won't retaliate

No, you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know, whoa-oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be

Then I know, whoa-oh
That I'll never let it be
A World War III
World War III
World War III She walks away
Colors fade to gray
Every precious moment's now a waste
She hits the gas hoping it would pass
The red lights starts to flash
It's time to wait

And black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no
A world I never knew

She hates the sun 'cause it proves she's not alone
And the world doesn't revolve around her soul, no
She loves the sky 'cause it validates her pride
Never lets her know when she is wrong

And black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no
Yeah, and the walls are closing in
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let them inside

And black keys never looked so beautiful
And a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull, oh
And the lights out never had this bright a glow
And the black keys
Showing me a world I never knew, no

Don't let 'em get (Don't let 'em get)
Inside of your head (No)
Don't let 'em get inside of your head
Don't let 'em get (Don't let 'em get)
Inside of your head

Inside of your head
Sometimes, you'll find it's better black and white OMG, did you hear I'm dating a Jonas Brother?
It's so hot!

You met in work, you should've known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you'll find out soon that the treatment wasn't worth it
They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even being funny

Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
This little thing they call a video girl

Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
(Of the video girl syndrome)
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

You know it's bad when your mama doesn't like her
All your friends saying she's a liar
Never ending phone calls aren't enough
(It's not enough, it's never enough)
Move to LA, got no talent
Not even like you won a Miss Teen pageant
Daddy pays your bills, but you still whine

Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
What happens to a man when he gets in the hands of a

Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds

And that I didn't deserve you

'Cause I don't know if I'll get up
And I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm dyin' without your love
Begging to hear your voice
Tell me you love me too
'Cause I'd rather just be alone
If I know that I can't have you

Lookin' at the letter you that you left
(The letter that you left, will I ever get you back?)
Wondering if I'll ever get you back
Dreaming about when I'll see you next

That you are my beautiful
I try to come closer with you
But they all say we won't make it through

So, say goodbye 'cause I won't be back again
Up and down, you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
La-la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la

You say you didn't mean to break my heart
But, girl, you did, I'm over it
Adieu to you and all your games
And all your crazy friends
This is the end

You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

I held your hand (Ah, ah)
It felt like a movie
I made some plans (Ah, ah)
But you were already moving on now
I'm stuck under a rainy cloud

But it's alright 'cause it's

Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf, yeah
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt

My heart is hangin' on the line
Is it me, girl, or someone else?
Please take me off the shelf

Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf

La, la, la, la, la

Building up the strength just to say

I'm sorry for breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
You told me this time is the last time
That I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

Filled with sorrow, filled with pain
Knowing that I am to blame for leaving your heart out in the rain
And I know you're gonna walk away
Leave me with the price to pay, before you go I wanted to say
Yeah

That I'm sorry for breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
You told me this time is the last time
That I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

I can't make it alive on my own
But if you have to go, then please girl, just leave me alone
'Cause I don't wanna see you and me going our separate ways
Begging you to stay if it isn't too late

I'm sorry for breaking all the promises
That I wasn't around to keep
You told me this time is the last time
That I will ever beg you to stay
But you're already on your way

I've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool 'cause we're just friends

Thinking about how
We're gonna say our vows
It's cool, we're just friends
As she walks down the aisle
I see all my friends smile
'Cause now we're more than friends

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
'Til the end of time
'Til I'm on your mind
It'll happen
We've been making lots of plans
Like a picket fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
Keep on thinking
Of when we used to be just friends

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
When we used to be just friends
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, yeah
When we used to be just friends Well, here we are again
Throwing punch lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out

No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

Every single word's been said (Whoa)
Broke each other's hearts again (Oh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out

No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight
(We got to work this out)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight

No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well then maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well, we know we're in love, so let us keep it alive
(Keep it alive, keep it alive)
(Tonight)
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out Keys to an open door, it don't mean a lot
Stains on a dirty floor, you don’t see a spot
What do I mean, what do I mean to you?
Waging a war inside you, but don’t see the scars
You got the moon guide you, who needs a star?
What do I mean, tell me, what do I mean to you?

What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I, what do I mean to you?

No need for water, Rita, you got the wine
Searching for diamonds when I gave you the mine
What do I mean?
Tell me, what do I mean to you, to you?
I'm a believer, Jesus (hallelujah)
Show me the light
The side of the road, the devil gave you a ride
What do I mean?
Tell me, what do I mean to you?
Hallelujah

What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I, what do I mean to you?

A child needs a mother
And you want trust but not the truth
I’m just a lover
So what do I mean to you?

What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I, what do I mean to you? I was sittin' at home watching TV all alone
I'm so tired of reruns, I've memorized this show
So I pick up the phone, call everyone I know
Said there's going to be a party, hit the music, here we go
Yeah

You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Hey! hey! hey!

We were out on the floor, yeah, we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch and said that it was late
Then she pulled me aside and said she couldn't stay
(I really gotta go)
But I begged her for one more song, let the music play
Yeah

You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Hey! hey! hey!

I drove her home, and then she whispered in my ear
The party doesn't have to end
We can dance here

Live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?

You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
(You got to live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?)
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?

Live...to...party! She was all I ever wanted
She was all I ever needed and more
But she walked out my door

Then she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you

We had fun under the sun
And when winter came, she'd be my angel
We were so in love

Then, she went away
Left my heart in two
Left me standing here
Singing all these blues, yeah

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you

I don't know what hurts worse, baby
Seeing you with him or being alone
On my own
I know he doesn't love you, baby
Not like I did
Oh, what's the point?
You're not listening anyway

You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you
You left without a single word
Not even sorry
It might've hurt worse to hear you say
I'm leaving, goodbye
But your smile still makes my heart sing
Another sad song
I can't forget it
I won't regret it
'Cause I'm still in love with you Pick up all your tears
Throw 'em in your back seat
Leave without a second glance
Somehow, I'm to blame
For this never-ending racetrack you call life

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you on the finish line

You're driving all your friends out
You just be, you cannot follow
And soon, you will be on your own
Somehow, I'm to blame
For this never-ending racetrack you call life

So turn right (Turn right)
Into my arms
Turn right (Turn right)
You won't be alone
You might (You might) fall off this track sometime
Hope to see you at the finish line

I did all I could
And I gave everything
But you had to go your way
And that road was not for me

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might (You might) fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you at the finish line You never listen to me
I know I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true
Yeah, we all see through you
No, it won't be hard to do
Throw away my stuff from you

And I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl

You were the one I thought I
Needed, I'm better off alone
Everybody knows it's true
They know all your secrets
The only thing you knew was true
Has just walked out of your life
How does it feel?

So I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl

She will be there, to love and to care
I know there's no need to worry
The girl of my dreams
The one that will be
There to hold me when I'm down
'Til she's around

And I'll just wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl
Oh yeah
And I'll wait for her to come
She won't break my heart
'Cause I know she'll be from Australia
She is so beautiful
She's my dream girl
La, la, la, la, la, la
She's my dream girl (Dream girl) Such a thrill of a lifetime

And I gotta prepare myself
'Cause this feeling's getting stronger everyday
Something's creeping inside
Everything is about to change
Gotta face the fact that I can't walk away

This is critical
I'm feeling helpless
So hysterical, this can't be healthy
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe
This is critical, yeah
So stuck on you

Used to have everything figured out
But it's different now
When you came, you saw
You conquered my heart
It's your laugh and your smile
Wanna stay for a little while
I don't wanna go, I just want you in my arms

This is critical
I'm feeling helpless
So hysterical, this can't be healthy
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe
This is critical, yeah
So stuck on you

Used to run and hide
Used to bend our love
But I can't escape this time
Oh no

This is critical
I'm feeling helpless
So hysterical, this can't be healthy
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me
Baby, you're the air I breathe
This is critical, yeah

Baby, it's so critical (Critical)
It's so critical (Critical), yeah
I don't like it
It's so critical (Critical)
It's so critical (Critical), yeah
So stuck on you Run, run like you do
I'm chasing you
I'm on your tail, I'm gaining fast, you're going nowhere
Try to fix what you've done
And turn back the sun
The night is calling, and we're falling faster now

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

Stop, tell me the truth
'Cause I'm so confused
Spinning around, these walls are falling down, and I need you
More than you know
I'm not letting go
I'm getting close, so take my hand and please just tell me why

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away, oh

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

Pushin' me away Take my hand tonight
We can run so far
We can change the world to anything we want
We can stop for hours, just staring at the stars
They shine down to show us

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast, we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

We could run forever if you wanted to
I would not get tired
Because I'd be with you
I keep singing this song until the very end
We have done all these things

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast, we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

I would give it all
Never let you fall
'Cause you know, we're inseparable
I would give it all
Just to show you I'm in love
'Cause you know, we're inseparable

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast, we can fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable I'll pick you up at seven, we can drive around and see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning, but you'll be the one that moves me
I've been hurt before, so baby, promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too, yeah

You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby

Gonna treat you right, we're never gonna fight
Now baby, you can trust me
When I hold you tight, I feel alright
I guess that I'm just lucky
I've been hurt before, so baby, promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too

You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be

We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby
You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Yeah

Listen girl, you're outta control
I think that you and me would be a great coup-
Oh...
Yeah She's the kinda girl that you see in the movies
Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me
Down by the shore, first weekend of the summer
Gotta take a chance and just ask for her number
I wish I had a song on MTV
'Cause in a crowded room, I'd be the only one shed see
She's looking bored and now, I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be
Another minute, everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

She's looking at her watch while the DJ is spinning
This could be the end or it's just the beginning
She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better
Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never
I wish that I was on the radio
I'd sing her favorite song, she'd be front row at every show
This parties lame and now, I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be
Another minute, everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye
Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy, that guy, that guy, that guy
Yeah
Time is passing by
I'm losing my mind
I need
One, two, three, four, five minutes with you

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's where I wanna be
Another minute, everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes Try to turn on my TV to get you out of my head
Feeling something deep inside
That I just won't admit
It's not like I don't want to come in (want to come in)
I just don't know why I can't
Stop feeling like this

Tell me why (why, why)
Does it hurt so bad
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it make me mad
Tell me why
Tell me why

Now you're off with someone else
And I'm stuck at home
It's getting late and now I'm feeling so alone
Now I can see the storm's not going to clear
(not going to clear)
Dressed in my pain and out of my tears

Tell me why (why, why)
Does it hurt so bad (you make it hurt so bad)
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it make me mad
Tell me why
Tell me why

Now I'm in pain because
Losing you is not all I lost this time

Tell me why (why)
Does it hurt so bad
Tell me why (why)
Does it make me mad
(Why, why)
(Why, why)

Tell me why (why, why)
Does it hurt so bad (why does it hurt so bad)
Tell me why (why, why)
Does it make me mad Mic check
Can you hear me?
Gotta know if I'm coming in clearly
Static through the speakers
In a second, your heart will be fearless
Taken for granted
Right now, you can't stand it
Break down
It's a showdown
Got to scream it out loud

'Cause I'm not faking
Girl, I'm just saying

Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it
Let's leave the past behind us
Come on, shout it out
Hey you

Not open to suggestions
I'm dreaming of you and me dancing
No one's interfering
Got to do it ourselves
We don't need them
Long as we're together
We won't want anybody else, baby
Tell me if you're ready
'Cause tonight you will see

That I'm not faking
Girl, I'm just saying

Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it
Let's leave the past behind us
Come on, shout it out
Hey you

You doubted me
And you trusted me
And I made you see
How to find your relief
I don't know what to say
Get on your way
I gotta hear you scream

Hey you, hey you
Now we're into something new
Hey you, hey you
Now you're feeling like I do
Come on, shout it

From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I’m feelin' so cool, yeah

Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I’m feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It’s like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell ’em for a dollar or two (Two)
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

Must’ve done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it’s Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool

Cool We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future
We're the kids, we're the kids
We're the kids of the future

Standing on a dirty, old rooftop
Down below, the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Come on, Lewis, keep moving forward
Hold your head up high
There's no time for looking down
You will not believe where we're going now

Here we go, let me remind you
Look ahead, the past is behind you

We're the kids of the future, whoa-oh

Looking for a place you belong to
Looking for a family that wants you

He told me that I had a problem
But I realized it's you
I tried to scratch away the issue
All I ever get is tissues
So I can wipe away my tears, yeah

Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy

Now, I found out you were lying
When you told me you were trying
Just to medicate the rash
Tangled vines, they are deceiving
From the lines that now are leading
To the truth I need to hear

Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everyone's allergic to poison ivy

Yeah, I break out and I start to shake
When I hear your name, I can't walk away
I just can't do it, I can't stop even if I try
Lay down my pride, I can't walk away
I get burned and I have to learn
That the court's adjourned, can't walk away
Tied up in my tangled thoughts
I'm trying, just can't walk way
Poison, poison, poison ivy

Everyone's allergic to poison ivy
Everybody needs a little poison ivy
Everybody wants a little poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everybody needs a little poison ivy
Everybody gets the itch, everybody hates that
Everybody needs a little poison ivy

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Give me some poison, baby Hey, there, pretty lady

And this, right here, is how I feel

Now, you got me begging, baby
Begging, baby, please
All I wanna know is do you wanna get away?

Ah London's nice, but it’s not sunny
The desert's hot 'cause there's no rain
You can laugh, but it’s not funny
I've found a place where my heart will stay

Tokyo's fast, but I'm not winded
New York's cash, but that's ok
Italy's a priceless memory
Just go walk the streets of Spain

But I've found
That I left my heart in Scandinavia
Left my heart in Scandinavia
Left my love inside of her arms

Yea, I left my heart in Scandinavia
In Scandinavia

Yea, I left my heart
In Scandinavia Try to fall asleep tonight
I lay awake and dream of life
When we thought we could make it
Wasted all our time
But I wouldn't change
A single thing I know

We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love and I wish
That it could be the way that it was
But it's over, there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same

Two wrong don't make it right
Too hearts are on the line
Maybe we could've made it
I've waited countless nights
In the end, I'm a friend
But that's all I am to you, oh

We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love and I wish
That it could be the way that it was
But it's over, there's no one to blame
No, It'll never be the same

No, it'll never be the same

We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love and I wish
That it could be the way that it was
But it's over, there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same

It'll never be the same
No it'll never be the same

It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over there's no one to blame
It'll never be the same One, two, three, four!
Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle pop
You can lick it, shake it, and dunk it
Sweet candy fun!

Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle Pop

Baby Bottle Pop, baby bottle pop
You can lick it, shake it and dunk it I'm waiting for you right outside
The place we first locked eyes (Oh)
I feel like we're both losing sight
We don't get to do this twice
And I wonder

Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done?
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

The last time that I left these steps
Was after our first kiss
I wonder why you haven't shown
I'll be leaving here alone
And I wonder

Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done?
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

(So bored with these games)
Splitting apart, it getting hard to tell what you want
So bored with these games
(So bored with these games)
Splitting apart, it getting hard to tell what you want
(Yeah) So bored with these games
(So bored with these games)
Splitting apart, it getting hard to tell what you want
So bored with these
I'm left in the dark
I never thought you would be breaking my heart
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done?
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (Games), games (Games)

Games (Games), oh, games
Games I thought I was cool
But I just looked a fool for so long
Now you're gone, now you're gone, yeah

Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me, yeah

I recall all our fights
Most of all, all the times
You would lie in my arms
Now you're gone, you're gone, yeah

Don't speak to me
Don't be my aim

There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light

It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
Cause our love won't survive

Yeah, our love won't survive
Don't speak a word

Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me, yeah

There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light

It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
Cause our love won't survive As time was ticking, we were winning
And it all was going as planned
Politicians stand between the
Lines of making headlines, street signs
Saying you're going the wrong way
Fading faster now

You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
And don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts and live like robots
'Cause we all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
We're gone, so gone

Fallen soldiers, all around us
But we're still standing strong
Embarrassing and contradicting
'Cause now we're making headlines, primetime
Saying, ""What a story!""
Billboards, packed tours
Don't forget

You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
And don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts and live like robots
'Cause we all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
We're gone, so gone

And game over, you're done
Out of left field, we won
Pack our bags
Yeah, we'll run
Hollywood, here we come

You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
And don't forget to
Hold back your thoughts and live like robots
'Cause we all know what goes on
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
We're gone, so gone

You can try to break us
And make us fall apart
But the fires in our hearts
Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone I am what I am, I can't help myself
And if you don't like it, get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways, it's not a phase
This is how it is and this is how it's gonna stay
Because

I am what I am, I know what I'm not
I'm not the type of guy that doesn't know what he's got
And I won't back down, won't come around
Saying that I changed 'cause that's not how it's going down

'Cause I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!

I am what I am, what can I say?
I'm gonna be this way right up until my dying day
Because that's how it goes, head to my toes
And if it doesn't show, well, I just had to let you know
Because

I am what I am
And nobody else
And if you've got a problem, better take it somewhere else
Because I can't turn back, I'm right on track
And if you think you know, well, then you better check your facts
Because

'Cause I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!

Oh, can't you see? I'm just being me
I can't be you and I don't wanna be
Don't try to get inside my head
'Cause what you see is what you get

I am what I am, I can't help myself
And if you don't like it, get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways, it's not a phase
This is how it is right up until my dying day

And I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!
I am what I am
Hey! hey!

I am what I am You dream of a day when the songs that you play
Are blasting through the speakers in your car
Then it comes in a flash and you hear the crowd
Screaming out your name for the encore

Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real?
Hold on tight, don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright, but still keep it real

Who could know that you'd be on the road
Selling out the tickets to your show?
When you're home, you're still the one
You were before you left to go on tour

Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real? Yeah
Hold on tight, don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright, but still keep it real

Did you ever think your dreams (Would become a reality?)
All you did was just believe

Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real?
Yeah

Livin' life, life in the fast lane
Not that bad, no one can complain
Who's to say that we won't keep it real?
Hold on tight, don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright, but still keep it real I walked across the crowded street
A sea of eyes, they cut through me
And I saw you in the middle
Your upset face, you wear it well
You camouflage the way you feel
When everything's the matter

We've all been down that road before
Searching for that something more

World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath
People change and promises are broken
Clouds can move and skies will be wide open
Don't forget to take a breath

Blink our eyes, life's rearranged
To our surprise, it's still okay
It's the way things happen
Summer comes, and then it goes
Hold on tight, and brace for cold
And it's only for a moment

We've all been down that road before
Searching for that something more

World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath
People change and promises are broken
Clouds can move and skies will be wide open
Don't forget to take a breath

Life isn't suffocating
Air isn't overrated

World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath

World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?
Just take a breath
Take a breath

People change and promises are broken
Clouds can move and skies will be wide open
Don't forget to take a breath

World's spinning 'round
There's no sign of slowing down
So, won't you take a breath?

Don't forget to take a breath
Don't forget to take a breath I can feel you all around
In the silence, I hear the sound
Of your footsteps on the ground
And my heart slows down
So now I'm

I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

Something’s changing deep inside
All my hopes are comin' alive
As we're fading into the night
I can see your eyes
So I keep on

I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

See in the darkness, believe we can make this
All we want is to be
We can stay forever 'cause when we're together
I'm stuck in this fantasy
I don't wanna leave

And I'll keep waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
I'm waiting for the moonlight
So I can find you in this perfect dream
Don't think that you can hide there in the shadows
Girl, you're not invisible
Girl, you're not invisible
You're all that I can see

And my heart slows down Yeah, hey, baby, why you treating me bad?
Hey, darling, you're making me mad
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Oh, oh

Hey, baby, what's the matter with you?
Hey, darling, know your love isn't true
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

Hey, baby, why you bein' a fool?
Hey, darling, always been good to you
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Oh, oh

Yeah, hey, baby, why you treating me bad?
Hey, darling, you're making me mad
I'm going crazy trying to figure out why you are leaving
Give me a reason

Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you the feeling of misery
Baby, and terrible, scary
I need you to leave me alone

Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
Oh, oh
Hey, baby I'm going under, and this time, I fear there’s no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you’re not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Someone you loved
Someone you loved

And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down, then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Someone you loved, yeah-yeah
Someone you loved
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved Every time I think I'm closer to the heart
What it means to know just who I am
I think I finally found a better place to start
No one ever seems to understand
I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
Gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you
Oh yeah
Yeah

You're the remedy I'm searching hard to find
To fix the puzzle that I see inside
Painting all my dreams the color of your smile
When I find you it will be alright
I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
Gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
Gotta find you

Been feeling lost
Can't find the words to say
Spending all my time stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I wanna be
Next to you, you next to me
Oh
I need to find you
Yeah Her voice is echoed in my mind
I count the days till she is mine
Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh
I love a girl from senior class

I daydream through my freshman math
While she fills out her college apps
I'll show her a world where we belong
But she'll have to drive us to the prom

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends, I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need
That's what I go to school for
That's what I go to school for

Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen
But that doesn't bother me
He's back at college out of town
I find a reason to go around
I climb a tree outside her home
To make sure that she's alone
She looks up and sees me there
Still I can't help but stop and stare

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends, I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need
That's what I go to school for
That's what I, that's what I, that's what I go to school for

Everyone that you see all day knows you're looking at me in a different way
I guess that's why my marks are getting so high
I can see those tell tale signs telling me that I was on your mind
I could see that you want it more when you told me that I'm what you go to school for
I'm what you go to school for

She's made her choice and I'm the one
At least 'til graduation comes
We drive past school to wave goodbye
My friends, they can't believe their eyes

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing
That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends, I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need
That's what I go to school for
That's what I, that's what I, that's what I go to school for You say you'll know when you really find the one
But it's hard to tell with the damage that's been done
But I’d like to say that it's your fault
But I know better
‘Cause I'm a fool to think you'll wait around forever

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right
Oh, to make it right, yeah

I didn't know how good you were for me
Now it's clear I'm seeing all that we could be
And I know that it's my fault, but I'm gonna treat you better
'Cause if I had one wish, you'd be with me forever

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

Oh, is there something I can say?
Show me how to break it down
So before you walk away
Take the time to turn around
Listen to me now

Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
Maybe I could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

Oh, to make it right
Make it right
Gonna make it right, oh, yeah I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me kinda strange
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a change
And I fortunately know a little secret
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain
In need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
They come flocking to me crying
""Will you help us, pretty please?""
And I help them!
Yes I do!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
They're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On ladies who withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man

Poor unfortunate souls
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy person and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
If you wanna cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp
Take a breath
Go ahead
Sign the scroll
Nick and Kevin
Now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
You poor unfortunate souls

In pain
In need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
They come flocking to me crying
""Will you help us, pretty please?""
And I help them!
Yes I do!

Those poor unfortunate souls ""Jealous"" by Nick Jonas:

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful (Beautiful)
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why) I still get jealous

Still don't know what I've been chasing
But my eyes still can see
Bluer skies that wait for me

Took my love and threw it on the ground
Saying goodbye, girl, don't make a sound

I'm a one man show (One man show)
I don't need no one (Need no one)
I'll be fine alone (Fine alone)
Oh, yeah
You can call me, but (Call me, but)

'Cause I'm a one man show (One man show)
Oh, yeah

Now, I finally see
Everything you did to me
We thought it might change
And we could find a place
Where we would be happy, too

I'm a one man show
I don't need no one
I'll be fine alone (Fine alone)

Hey
Hey It all makes sense
Everybody listen to the words she says
Heading towards a consequence
For every bit of ignorance, incompetence
It's time for us to work it out

We got to work, work it out
Before the day is done
We got to be a bit stronger
'Cause we'll need it when tomorrow comes
We got to work, work
Work it out
We got to work, work
Work it out

She made her point
Building up the courage just to raise her voice
Heading towards a consequence
For every bit of ignorance, incompetence
It's time for us to work it out

We got to work, work it out Baby girl, I'm just a bit confused

Oh yeah
The summer heat
Has been getting to me
And last summer’s love is gone, gone, gone

I've been saving my love for a rainy day
And it's really coming down today

Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make a broken heart go away
I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna blame it on the summer rain

I'm blind to some things
Yeah, blind as love
But I can see us living it up, oh yeah
When you're next to me
The butterflies are flying
I know everything is fine, fine, fine

I've been saving my love for a rainy day, oh yeah
And now I'm looking for a twist of fate

Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
Baby, you could make a broken heart go away

I have a choice, but I don't know what to feel
Getting tired of all this fear
Before I choose, let me know that you'll be here
Let me know that you'll be here

'Cause I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
'Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

When I'm far away from where you are
It's ok, 'cause we're under the same stars
I'm laying down this heavy load (This heavy load)
Maybe now I can finally let this go
I can finally let you know

But I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
'Cause you're the one who helps me see

This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

My heart goes boom as the stars go blue
Like a sea of cell phone lights
The moon gets light as the sun goes down
Somewhere behind the Hollywood sign
Have you ever felt like you're living in the shadows?
Have you ever felt kept down?
I know sometimes that it feels like a battle
But it can turn around

Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

The kick drum starts as the boulevard
Fills up with all the boys and girls
From Jersey Town to the L.A. Crowd
They hear us all over the world
Have you ever felt like standing on a rooftop
Have you ever wanted to scream?
Everybody dance, burn it up till we blast off
Just like a rockin' machine (Yeah!)

Hey!
This is the night!
This is the night!
Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive

'Cause we're not alone tonight
So raise up your hands and touch the sky

Hey!
I'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive We had a lot of good times when we were together
And I thought we'd last forever, you and I
I.M for so long, I couldn't wait to get your phone call
Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright
Tonight you called me on the phone
Said you had to stay at home
Is there something I should know? Yeah

I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, whoa-oh

The night after you're phone call
Me and friends were hanging at the mall
I was not believing what I saw, whoa
Holding hands with him and sitting closer then six inches
Hoping she's not gonna kiss him now
How can I call you a friend? You stood me up in the end
I know that it's over, yeah

I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, whoa-oh

Don't keep telling me that you're sorry now
But let me tell you how much this hurts me too
Yeah, oh

I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, whoa-oh
I was fine 'til 7:05
'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone, I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye

But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye), whoa-oh
Goodbye I met you in a dream
And your piercing eyes were staring straight at me
I can't believe this feeling
You make me feel so much
I want you always near me
Is this really what it seems?

What you, what you're feeling
Let me know it immediately
And surely, surely I will
Understand you (more and more)
I'm beginning to get confused (more and more)
It's, it's suffocating (more and more)
Come on here

I need you
I want you
I got to have you
It's infatuation

Love, I've finally found a new
And it came to me inside your vision
Now I know I need you so
You make me feel like crazy

Because our love is destiny

Let me know it immediately
And surely, surely I will

And it's my favorite song

And everything will be alright
'Cause we're soaking up the sweet sunshine
Not a worry on my mind
Everybody's feelin' fine
And everything will be alright

There's a party tonight
Where the moon shines bright
Bring your friends and I'll bring mine

Why can't come out tonight
I'm not trying to cut you loose
I just need some time

Oh-o-o-oh

You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
Oh, call the the doctor
I'm love sick

Going back and for so long
And you're getting over
Waiting on me to be strong
And you start to wonder

You're the one I think about
It's every day, it's every night
O-oh, call the the doctor
I'm love sick

It's every day, it's every night
Oh, call the doctor
I'm love sick I was in the background
Fading out to the fuel
She was on the front lines
Shouting ""Start up the room""
I want to get closer
But there's nothing I can do
What a shame (Yeah, yeah)

I'm headed for the exit
Guess it's time to hit the road
I wish she was with me
'Cause I, I just never know
I pull the car up thinking pedal on the floor
About to take off and she opens up the door

She said ""Let's get going, we got time""
I can see that look inside her eyes, yeah
And to my surprise, it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive
Come on now
Yeah

We were in the fast lane going to who knows where
No destination, but she don't seem to care
She kept me guessing with the moonlight in her eyes
So fierce now, yeah yeah
I start to question all the things that I don't know
She doesn't answer, she just turns up the radio, ooh yeah

She said ""Let's get going, we got time"" (We got time, we got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes
And to my surprise (and to my surprise) it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive

Sometimes in life, moments arrive
Things don't turn out the way that you planned
So never think twice
Just get in the car and drive
Yeah, yeah
Come on now
Come on now

She said ""Let's get going, we got time"" (We got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes, yeah
And to my surprise (and to my surprise) it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
(So get in the car and drive)

She said ""Let's get going, we got time"" (Got time, got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes, yeah
(I can see that look inside her eyes)
And to my surprise, it was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
You just can't think twice
So get in the car and drive
Yeah Wednesday I came home from school
Did my homework in my room
Then I watched some TV
I still miss you
Thursday morning went online
Got to school at half past nine
Wound up in detention
I still miss you

Everything I do, oh
Brings me back to you

And I die
One day at a time
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter how I try
Try to kill the time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time

Friday I got out of bed
Tried to smile, frowned instead
Burnt some toast for breakfast
I still miss you
Saturday I turned 16
Never dreamt you'd act so mean
You didn't even call me
But I still miss you

And when I turn 94
I think I'll miss you even more

And I die
One day at a time
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter how I try
Try to kill the time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time

I miss you more than I did a minute ago
I climb a mountain just to here your echo, you
All I wanted was you
Tell me ""Please, do you think of me now and then?
'Cause if I never see you again
I still miss you""

And I die
One day at a time
'Cause I just can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter how I try
Try to kill the time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time
Oh, one day at a time
Well, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time
Oh, I think that I'm just going crazy
One day at a time You can't stop the world
You can't do it all alone
It's too heavy for
You to carry all alone
But tonight you are
Mine
The world will be fine
It's just us in this moment
So

Don't think about the world
Stop blaming yourself
I know you do
Don't think about the world
Just me and you
Tonight

No I can't fly
Can't swim across the sea
I don't wonder why
It's just the way its gotta be
I love that you care
And I know that you're scared
It's just in this moment


Don't stress for nothing
Let me take you away
From all the madness
Just give in to me today
'cause you're all I want
Youre all I need
Right here and now
It's you and me Empty words, empty promises
Show me that I'm not cut out
For the road of the entertainer
Cause I'm really not that loud

Too much to do and too little time
Fix it now before it isn't right
Pick up the clock and mend the broken hand
All we got to do is just believe
That time is on our side

Pick up the clock and mend the broken hand
All we got to do is just believe
That time is on our side
That time is on our side You say, ""Yes,"" I say, ""No""
You say, ""Stop,"" and I say, ""Go, go, go""
Whoa

You say goodbye, and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don’t know why you say goodbye

I say hello

Hello, goodbye
Whoa, oh It was cloudy on that night
There were no stars in sight
Then the planets all aligned
When I saw her eyes
One look, that's all it took
To send me, to another galaxy
And she said

She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity

Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

We were watching star wars
She looked kinda bored
Said she'd seen it all before
Made me wonder even more

Which universe was hers?
What galaxy did she call home?
Yeah

She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Thank you gravity

Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
She's my space girl
And she's out of this world

She says the moon is overrated
And Jupiter's her favorite and Pluto can't hang (Pluto can't hang)
Like a meteor I'm falling from the first time I saw her
It was heaven on earth (Heaven on earth)

She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms

Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know
Yeah
She was on her way to Mars
Then she ran into a star
And she fell into my arms
Never let her go
I'll hide her UFO
She'll never have to know

She's my space girl
And she's out of this world Young hearts
I believe if we are not far
From becoming who we truly are
Love is on its way
Dreamers
You see everything in color
While the world is getting darker
Love is on its way

So, hold on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way
It's alright, you'll find
A brighter day
Cause love it on its way

Leaders
Show us how to love each other

Then together we will truly see
Love is on its way
Yeah

Cause love is on its, way You just don't know it
It's getting hard to say hello
You just don't know it
I'm on the edge of crossing the line
I don't wanna blow it and show it
Before you know you're mine
You just don't know it

Oh, you won't see me break
Won't make that mistake, oh no
I'll just walk away
There's too much at stake right now
I go on and on
Singing this song about you
And that's what's wrong with this song

Can you feel it?
In the way I look at you
Girl, can you hear it?
I'm crying out inside
I don't wanna see you
Be near you
You're a million miles too close

Oh, you won't see me break
Won't make that mistake, oh no
I'll just walk away
There's too much at stake right now
I go on and on
Singing this song about you
And that's what's wrong with this song
Whoa, that's what's wrong with this song

You don't know the way I feel (The way I feel)
So I'll stay alone (Stay alone)

Oh, you won't see me break
Won't make that mistake, oh no
I'll just walk away
There's too much at stake right now
I go on and on
Singing this song about you
And that's what's wrong with this song

That's what's wrong
That's what's wrong with this song
That's what's wrong with this song
And that's what's wrong with this song
You just don't know it Come on, guys, tell me what we're doing
We're hangin' around when we could be all over the place
The sun is shining just the way we like it
Let's get out of this hallway
Show the world our face

It's Friday, but there's nowhere to go
Anywhere is cool, but we're not going home
And we can do anything we wanna do
It's all up to me and you

Turn this park into a club
The stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
The skateboard, here's our ride
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us
So anywhere we are

Everybody knows
We got the party with us
Anywhere we are

Radio, let me be your DJ
I'll turn you up because we're moving 'til we're on a roll
Everyone is dancing to their own beat
And letting go, everybody here's got soul

It's Friday and there's nowhere to be
We're kicking it together, it's so good to be free
We got each other and that's all we need
The rest is up to you and me

Turn this park into a club
The stars and lights and the moon is the vibe from above
The skateboard, here's our ride
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us

Don't look back this time
Turn around, think about where you are now

She pulls up in her daddy's car, top down
I said you've got friends and I've got mine
And I got nothing on my mind
Rockin' out to my favorite songs
That's all I really need
Would it be better if you rolled with me?

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off
We're gonna set this party off

She looked at me like I was so crazy
I could tell she was in 'cause she didn't say no right away
She told that she would think about it
Girls like that that gotta keep you guessing
And then she blasted her favorite song
But I still heard her scream
Ready, here we go, with me

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

All I need is my favorite song
But it sounds better when you sing along
Sing along

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

We've got the words if you've got the melody, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
We've got the time if you've got the place to be, the place to be
We've got tonight to make every memory, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off
Yeah She's an underdog
Lives next door to me
She's always heard you won't amount to anything
And it kills me to watch the agony beyond her eyes
Tragic the way people pass her by
But now I realize

That everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
But she fakes it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

She's original
Never trying to fit in
She's got a way to always go
Against the grain
Oh yeh!
Someday, they'll see how beautiful she really is
I know that last will be the first
The tables gonna turn 'cause

Everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
But she fakes it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

Maybe she'll be in a movie
Maybe she'll be in a song, yeah
Better pay her some attention
Before she's gone

She's an underdog, yeah
She means the world to me, yeah

Everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
She hates it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world
Everyone sees her
But nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow
For a better tomorrow
She hates it
She hates it
Watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In southern california, much like arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour
When i'm thinkin' 'bout you
(ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you
(ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
'til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (ooh, ooh) Wouldn't it be nice if I had some tissues
Wipe away the tears that's right you got issues
Why do you keep asking questions when I don't care
And how many times will it take you to figure out
How much I hate you
I'm right, your wrong, move on


Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right
You're wrong
Move on


Wouldn't it be nice if you stopped whining
And telling all your friends that I've been lying
You can trust me when I tell you we're through (we're through)
And how many times will it take you
Do the math me minus you
I'm right, your wrong, move on




How many feelings will you harbor
Get over it your friends are so much hotter (oh yeah)
I'm right, your wrong, move on
I'm right, your wrong, move on

Cause you love me
And I hate you
I'm right
You're wrong
Move on

         We weren’t meant to get out of Jersey
Two stops past the parkway and that old cemetery
We weren't born to grow in a hurry
But it rained hard in the garden state and we shot up like weeds
Walking out of the red brick house, yeah, I could hear it screaming
""Please don't leave"" (Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh!)
(Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh! Oh, Oh!)

Calling you out, calling you out
So you can see what's going on
Breaking it down, breaking me down
'Cause I can see that something's wrong

Your body's moving
But your mind is somewhere else
And I don't know how to get there
It's like you're losing yourself

(Oh, oh)
No, I never thought that we'd come this far
(Oh, oh!)
Got enough for me to break my heart
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'till tomorrow

Calling you out, calling you out
'Cause I can see we're near the end
Letting me down, letting me down
It's like we're back to one again

Your body's moving
But your mind is somewhere else
And I don't know how to get there
It's like you're losing yourself

(Oh, oh)
No, I never thought we'd come this far
(Oh, oh!)
Got enough for me to break my heart
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

(Oh, oh!), no we're not gonna stop when they hit the lights
(Oh, oh!), when the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
(Oh, oh!), when the music stops promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow, yeah, hey, oh (Oh!)

(Oh, oh)
No, I never thought we'd come this far
(Oh, oh!)
Got enough for me to break my heart
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
Keep dancing 'til tomorrow
(Oh, oh)
No, we're not gonna stop when they hit the lights
(Oh, oh!)
When the rhythm is gone, do the one thing right
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops, promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow

Keep dancing 'til tomorrow
(Oh, oh)
No, we're not gonna stop
When they hit the lights
(Oh, oh!)
When the rest is wrong you're the one thing right
(Oh, oh)
When the music stops
Promise me that you won't let it go
We'll keep dancing 'til tomorrow Note: As this version has not been released, these lyrics are taken from the previously released version, which can be found here. Come back after this version comes out for the official lyrics!

No, this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here, but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

I'm tryna keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm
Yeah, like I did before the storm You, you're like driving on a Sunday
You, you're like taking off on Monday
You, you're like a dream
Dream come true
I, I'm just a face you never notice
And I, I'm just trying to be honest with myself
With you, with the world
You might think that I'm a fool for falling over you
So tell me what can I do to prove to you
That it's not so hard to do
Give love a try, one more time
Cause you know that I'm on your side
Give love a try, one more time
Yeah, yeah           
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
         I wrote this lyric for you
All by myself
What makes you think I need you
Or anybody else
But when you see me walking
Just staring at my feet
Cause I'm not all about you
I'm already complete

Hope this doesn't make you cry
But I don't wanna make you mine
I told you for the millionth time
That I don't need you in my life

But you can see through me (yeah)
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

I wake up thinking of you
And that weirds me out
I try hard not to call you
But I can't do without
Hearing your voice tell me
That I am on your mind
It wouldn't work to rush this
I'll come around in time

I hope that you can understand
Right now I don't know where I stand
I'd rather hide behind these walls
Pretending I don't care at all


Life keeps going on
The world keep spinning round
Can't we stop going in circles
Am I afraid of what they'll say
Or too confused to see
You and me

But you can see through me (yeah)
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud (I'm just afraid)
I'm just afraid
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

But you can see through me (You can see through me)
How you get to me (How you get to me)
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid
I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone This Christmas time there's just one thing I want
It top's it all, it's better than eggnog
It's cold outside, my boots are full of snow
I'm just hoping for some Mistle toe
Oh

You can take these presents, underneath my tree
You can take this awesome scarf my grandma made for me
You can take these boxes, tied up with string
Cause all I want for Christmas is the girl of my dreams
Yeah
Woah
Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho!!!
Yeah

Light's are going up it's Christmas time
But I just want that girl to be mine
My stocking's full but I'm not satisfied
No, No, No, No
But I'll just wait until she's by my side
Yeah

You can take these presents, underneath my tree
You can take this awesome scarf my grandma made for me
You can take these boxes, tied up with string
Cause all I want for Christmas is the girl of my dreams
Falalalala, lalalala
Faaaa la la laaa

You can take these presents, underneath my tree
You can take this awesome scarf my grandma made for me
I would give it all, just to let you see
That all I want for Christmas is the girl of my dreams

         Jonas Brothers Dear God Lyrics
Oohhh
Dear God
I hate to be a bother
But I got to say
This world is getting crazier with every day
I hope You'll hear me out now as I stop and pray
Dear God
People take Your words and try to twist them 'round
I know You can't be happy with what's going down
I'm searching for some answers
But they can't be found
Can You help me out?
Dear God
Oohhh
Dear God
Just the other night I heard somebody say
""What's the use believing in you anyway?""
I guess it was just heartache talking through the pain
It's a crying shame
Dear God
I know You're disappointed in the things we've done
Can't they see the truth that they're all running from?
Try to preach your message with a loaded gun
What they thinking of?
Dear God
Oohhh
Ooohh
Everybody's searching for an easy solution
Yeah
They can't see beyond, the selfish world they're living in
Your words of love get lost in all the confusion
Yes they do
But I still believe
Someday You're going to speak to me
Dear God
I know You've got a million other calls to take
You're dealing with a lot of things that just won't wait
But there is one request that I just got to make
Oohhh whoa
Dear God
Won't You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt
I'm trying to hear you but the silence is just to loud
I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds
And I hear you now
Dear God Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We pillage plunder, we rifle and loot
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We extort and pilfer, we filch and sack
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
Maraud and embezzle and even hijack
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We kindle and char and in flame and ignite
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
We burn up the city, we're really a fright
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

We're rascals and scoundrels, we're villains and knaves
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
We're jokers and black sheep, we're really bad eggs
Stand up me hearties, yo ho

We're beggars and blighters and ne'er do-well cads
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

Oh, oobee do
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too

Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Give me the secret, mancub
Clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you



Oh, oobee do
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
Oh, oobee do
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too Isn't it strange
Ain't it a shame
People walking down Broadway
Begging for change
We just walk by
Don't hear that they're crying
We just keep on typing on our two ways
Oblivious to other people's pain

Gotta open up our eyes
Gotta read between the lines
Gotta listen to the sound

Cause this is life
It's harder than it looks
You never get enough
The time
Keeps flying
In life
You only get one shot
So give thanks for what you've got right now
Don't you worry
Hey we're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
Gonna be alright yea
Woo
Hey hey hey

You feel so alone
Your problems at home
They always seem to follow you wherever you go
Caught in a daze
You wish you could change
But you always tell yourself
That hopes seems a million miles aways

Gotta wake up from your sleep
Gotta stay awake to dream
Gotta open your heart and believe
Oh



One two three yea
It's a roller coaster life
Up and down and side to side
Just shout to get it right She's got a smile
That I’d die for
Everyone knows, that I’m
A prisoner of war, for her
Yeah

Sometimes I wish
I had a kung fu grip
Never let her slip
Away she'd be my girl

I Really wish she knew
What I feel is true
She'd be my darling
I would be her hero too

I’m so in love
With her
Don’t care who knows
That I’m
Ready to fight, ready to go
Just like a G.I. Joe







She'd be my darling
I would be her hero too.  Looking at a picture of you in my hands
Wondering if I'm ever gonna see you again

Without you I don't know how my life will be
But I believe
It's not goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

So close yet so far
But in my heart you're here with me
You did not leave
You just went to live in eternity


You will live in the light of the sun again
Dancing in the river of life and
Knowing that'll never end and forever by my side
I'll never have to say goodbye

Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity

It's not goodbye
Cause I will remember you
And I will see you again
When I rise
Cause I know and I believe
I will see you in eternity
I will see you in eternity I'm hot
You’re cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on

I saw Santa Jumping through my sprinkler
Rudolph, Jack Frost, & Reindeer
Opened up a lemonade stand on my corner
2 cups for a dollar

Open up your eyes
Crazy summertime
No words you'll find
Upside down the weather man says snow
But its burning up outside
Its always summertime

Push play
Today, I saw my girlfriend
At the beach, putting sunscreen on a penguin
Just when I thought it couldn't get weirder
I saw the grinch at the boardwalk with my teacher


Always summertime
Always summertime

My teachers with the Grinch
Crazy summertime
And saint nick is getting drenched
Always summertime
And now Rudolph's getting hitched
Crazy summertime

All elves are in Hawaii

Open up your eyes
Crazy summertime
No words you'll find
Upside down the weather man says snow
But it's burning up outside
Its always summertime
Open up your eyes
Crazy summertime
No words you'll find
Upside down the weather man says snow
But it's burning up outside
Its always summertime Joy to the world! The Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare him room!
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we travel so far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star


Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
(Whoa!)

Joy to the world! The Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare him room!
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
Let heaven, heaven and nature heaven and nature sing
(Oh! Oh Oh!) Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Aisling away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me, take on me
Take me on, take on me
I'll be gone in a day or two

Needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning life is OK
Repeat after me
It's so much better to be safe than sorry


Take on me, take on me
Take me on, take on me
I'll be gone in a day or two
In a day or two
In a day or two We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side

When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
Oh, I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah"
