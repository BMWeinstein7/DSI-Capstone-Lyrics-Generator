"I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I know everybody on this island seems so happy
On this island, everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh, how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I'm beautiful
'Cause I wasn't looking for love, no

Nobody asked you to get me attached to you
In fact, you tricked me
And I wasn't trying to fall in love, but boy, you pushed me
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
'Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today

'Cause I've had my heart broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby, I'm yours

I'm mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What's wrong with you?
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do?
What can I do? Ohh

And I wasn't tryin'
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lyin'
If I said I wasn't scared to fall again
But if you promise me you'll catch me
Then it's okay

'Cause I've had my heart broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby, I'm yours

Oh I hate that I (Yeah)
Spend my days just wasting time (Yeah) daydreaming till I see you again (Yeah)
I'm not used to this (Yeah)
Oh, I used to be (Yeah) so used to boys just using me (Yeah)
For you to be you to me (Yeah)
Feels new to me (Yeah)
'Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I'm falling again
Falling again

But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby, I'm yours
Oh baby, I'm yours Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh

My daddy says that life comes at you fast
We all like blades of grass
We come to prime and in time we just wither away
And it all changes
My view with a looking glass won’t catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
See I recall being afraid of the dark
And holding on to teddy bears
I’d wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now I’m here
And the night is mine

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait 'til I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

My mother said don’t forget where you come from, where you’ve been
Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away
They keep you grounded
Oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
And yeah I guess that sounded nice when I was ten
Oh but never were there truer words
In all my days I’ve ever heard
And when she told me little girl the answer is love
So those are words that I keep with me
Though the seasons change so quickly
Keep them buried in my heart
And never fought

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said take my time and breathe
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

I been goin on, I been growin up
I’m a know it all, I don’t know enough
See I was racing and waiting for the day that I would be old enough
Guess I’ll be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough

I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said ""take your time to breathe""
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen I won't tell you I'm lonely
'Cause it may be selfish
I won't ask you to hold me
'Cause that won't mend what's helpless

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing for your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

I can't float in an ocean
That's already been drained
I won't cry at your feet now
I know my tears will fall in vain

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing for your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

No use wondering
Why your change in heart has wandered
So I'll ask you this question
'Cause it might help me sleep longer

Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you run out of love for me?

Out of love (Out of love)
Out of love (Out of love)
Out of love with me Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said that we were meant to be forever
An' I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Hoo-waa)
Go 'head and wish me well
(Haaa) I'll cry a wishing well
(Haaa) I'll fly before I fail
(Haaa) I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had, I can't pretend
That I don't miss you every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
(Hoo-waa)
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Hoo-waa)
Go 'head and wish me well
(Haaa) I'll cry a wishing well
(Haaa) I'll fly before I fail
(Haaa) I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

(Wooo-aaaa-ooh)
Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Hoo-waa)
Go 'head and wish me well
(Haaa) I'll cry a wishing well
(Haaa) I'll fly before I fail
(Haaa) I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears You're on your own, kid
You are

Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, ""Now, don't you overreact""
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don’t know if I even care for ""grown"" if it's just alone, yeah

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
No, no, no band-aids for the growing pains It's time I let you go
I made the mistake, go writing your name on my heart
'Cause your colors showed
But it was too late, you left me stained, called it art
Do you crave control?
I've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long
So you should go
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone
Alone, alone

There ain't no love 'round here
I loved you once, but it made me dumb
Now I'm seeing it way too clear
You hurt me numb, and for that I've run out of time
To have pain to feel (Pain to feel)
I've been your game
Just taking the blame for too long
Get on out of here
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone

Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely

Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone

Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely Run, run like the devil’s behind us
Run to where no one can find us
Be my accomplice to my crime
Oh baby
Run, run cause we’re guilty as sin
Run cause we know we won’t win
We know together we kill time

You’ll never face a judge without me
You’ll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I’ll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time, with you…

We’ll be Outlaws
We’ll take on the world
We’ll be Outlaws

Run, run like you never did
Cause they found the evidence
And they found your fingerprints
All on me and baby run
Run like your life depends on it
Let’s make forever in this moment
Tell me you love me again, Oh again
And I would waste away without you 
You’re the shinin' to my star
I’d be searching till I found you
Wherever you are… You are

We’ll be Outlaws
Partners in crime
We’ll take on the world together
I’m Bonnie you can be Clyde
We’ll be Outlaws
You and me
They’ll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
O-O-O-Ohhhhhh-o-o-oh
O-O-O-Ohhhhhh-o-o-o-oh

You’ll never face a judge without me
You’ll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I’ll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time
With you…
Oh with you
W-i-t-h you
With you Oh-o-o-o

We’ll be Outlaws
Partners in crime
We’d take on the world together
I’m Bonnie you can be Clyde
We’ll be Outlaws
You and me
They’ll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
We’ll be Outlaws… So much on my mind, I think I think too much
Read between these lines, unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side, it blurs

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Change in every wind
The sands of time don't know our name
Oh nothing's sure, but surely as we stand
I promise I will stay the same
And I've never seen forever
But I know we'll remain

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone
(Oooooooh oooh oooh)
Be my stone
(Oooooooh oooh oooh)
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Oh steady me, be my source of gravity
While my world's unraveling
Say you'll never change, ooooohhhh!!! Oh!

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone
(Oooooooh oooh oooh)
Be my stone
(Oooooooh oooh oooh)
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone I grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
And I'd wait to be saved, oh no
Up at night, hiding under covers found my escape
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing

I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?

Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid

I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
Oh, the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls

All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from ""when boredom strikes"" to ""Ms. Star on the Rise""
It was all in an instant man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them man

Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls
Those four pink walls Someday I won't be afraid of my head
Someday I will not be chained to my bed
Someday I’ll forget the day he left
But surely not today
One day I won't need a PhD
To sit me down and tell me what it all means
Maybe one day it'll be a breeze, ah
But surely not today, but surely not today

Oh, you don’t know what sadness means
'Til you're too sad to fall asleep
One day I'll be snoozing peacefully
But surely not today, surely not today

One day I'll swear the pain will be a blip
I'll have the hardest time recalling it
I'll be the king of misery management
But surely not today
One day that song won't make me cry anymore (Oh no no)
One day I’ll get up off the bathroom floor (Hey, yeah)
Oh, piece by piece I’ll be restored
But surely not today, surely not
Eh, not today

Oh, you don't know what happy means
If it’s only in your dreams
I'll be acquainted with my jollities
But surely not today, yeah, surely not today

Surely not-, surely, surely not-
Surely not-, surely not today

One day the thought of him won't hurt the same
Won't need distractions to get through the day
I guess I hope I’m gonna be okay
'Cause I'm not today Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down, down

I'm trying not to take too much
I'm in over my head
Over love, boy I over trust
Give me the chance to pick up the pieces you left me in
Why did I let you in?
Overzealous, I'm over this
Oh I'm over us
Over and over
I let you under my skin and it's over
I promise never again you'd come over
Something takes over me
I can't control this hallucinogen

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

We fight, we laugh
Detox, rehab
Letting go of what we had
Ohh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Over trying
Over lies
Over crying
Over-traumatized
Over-worked and moreover I'm done
Over and over
I'm falling under your spell, call me over
I'm runnin' back to this hell you come over
And didn't you say we were through?
Why can't I get over you?

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Boy I come crashing, crashing
Down from the high and wondering, wondering
Wondering why this ain't over
Let it just be over
Sobering thoughts taking over my mind

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down 5 AM, the moon went to sleep
Your friend speakin' in tongues in the back seat
Just one little glance, I know what you mean somehow
We're stealin' moments, moments away
Why are we just not as good in the day?
Is it too soon to know if it's too soon to say for now?

The bubble we're livin' in
Settin' me free again
I don't know what it is about this

I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done

Can't feel my hands, you laugh like you do
It happened like that accordin' to you
It's only a month, but doesn't feel new somehow
Yeah, yeah

Bubble we're livin' in
Settin' me free again
I don't know what it is about this

I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss
I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done

Paint a picture in my brain, encapsulate the fleetin' feelin'
It ricochets, replace my pain 'til every trace is leavin'
The nerve of autumn time, days flyin' by, every sunrise healin' me
And we're okay, we'll live this way 'til it's done

I'm gonna miss this when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss
I'm gonna miss this when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done

I'm gonna miss you when it's done There you are with your college friends
You played in a marching band
I can't help but wish I knew you then
But I guess I know you now

It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand

Hey, you
Hey, Mr. Knock On My Door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

Say that it's the same
Take a drill right to my brain
Oh the way you did just yesterday
I guess I get it now

It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand

Hey, you
Hey, Mr. Knock On My Door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
(A little more of you)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you I think it's safe to say that you will always change
New colours day-to-day; my friend, you are a hurricane
The look on your face, all the things you say
Send me to outer space; my friend, you test my patience

Don't you just push me out now
You got me into this mess, who's gonna get me out?
Why are you pulling me down
If you got things to figure out?

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me, yeah
Go steady your, your heavy heart until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, ready for me

Why do I care so much about you? Boy, you know I do
I think a million thoughts, but only half get through to you
You start a million fires just to see what they can do
But then you freeze up like winter season in June
I wanna climb into your mind and turn on all the lights
Read all your secrets, see if you wonder about mine
We're just kids tryin' to understand the world
You're still only a boy who's scared of a good girl

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me (Oh, no)
Go steady your, your heavy heart until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, ready for me

I won't be waiting for you to come around, to come around
I won't be waiting for you, but I'll be around, I'll be around

Don't you just push me out now
You got me into this mess, who's gonna get me out?
Why are you pulling me down
If you got things to figure out?

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
(Ready for me, no, no, no)
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
(Ready for me, no, no, no)
Go steady your (Steady your), your heavy heart (Heavy heart)
Until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, ready for me In my room, staying up late
And I'm planning my escape
Cause I know I can't stay
In my veins I got the feeling
Like there must be something more
I've never been so sure

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

These streets aren't easy
And I need your hand to hold
So I'm not alone
And I hear all these voices
Though they try to slow me down
I can tune them out

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
So I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

Here it goes
I clear my throat
And cue the violins
Making moves
Shout it from the rooftops
I'm trying to live, yeah

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
So I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side Knock on my door, boy, come home
You stay in my head
Lay in my arms, why won't you?
It's been way too long
What you waiting on?
'Cause I've been laying here
Learning what the memories won't do
See, I need you, and baby, I need to
Let down my guard and give you my scars
Open up my heart

We could be stars
We could be stars
We could be stars

Rap on my window, come home
It's been a while, so stick around
Why don't you?
'Til the end of time
Say that you'll be mine
An uphill climb fighting what the heart
Really wants to do
See, I need you
And sometimes we need to
Shed our facade and be just who we are
All broken and torn, then we could be stars

Oh, we could be stars
We could be stars
We could be stars

Piercing lights in the dark
Make the galaxy ours
Kingdom right where we are
Shining bright as a morning
You'll never be lonely
Just promise you'll love me
I'm never too far
And we'll never part
And we could be stars

Oh, we could be stars
We could be stars
Oh, we could be stars

Just find a way to get home
There's space in my heart
Open arms for you to run to
Baby, close your eyes and take the leap
To make believe in fairytales
I'll meet you there
Oh yeah, I'll fall too
See, I've wanted you here
All along but my fear
Just keeps haunting me, won't let me go
So it's hard to say ""I love you""

We could be stars
Oh, we could be stars
We could be stars
We could be stars Tune in to find my peace and solitude
These empty rooms spin, and I embrace the flaws of being human
The black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
The in between times
The meantimes that make this song of life sing
Play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
""Don't deviate,"" they say
But I will play what's best for me
I'll press the keys and pull the strings
Create a symphony that's mine

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

Let go
I let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
My own reverb is playing
Cause I'm a movement
There's dissonance, sometimes I make mistakes
Oh I'm human after all, I'm not your expectations
But play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
Just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
But I'll play what's best for me
I'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
My harmonious design

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

In my time here, I wanna be revered and remembered
Oh let them say I came, I conquered
So I won't fear and I can't blend in
You can't replace me and you cannot erase me
Cause my song will live on beyond time

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on If there's a God
Do you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?
As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?
Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter
Making boring people famous
Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters

We're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good TV

Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days

Does he hang his head at all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the loose ends
Stressed like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static, you’ll show us the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?

'Cause we're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, but don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created has made for damn good TV

Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days

Don't touch the remote, we'll be back in a moment
We are not hopeless, we are just coping
The mayhem is rolling, but it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent, chaotic, I know it
But we're growing, have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave up?

Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days
Yeah, oh, oh You went and turned the red flag white, darling, and you waved it
You've always had a way with words
Why can't you explain it then?
I see your face in everyone, baby, and I hate it
Who would have ever thought I'd have to erase it? Uh

Every little thing is reminding me of you
Yes, I'll set fire to my whole room (Ah, ah, ah)

I don't want to let it show, but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?

I double take at every phone that rings out of habit
I can't shake the little things, they're harder to manage, woah
I can't bury the past, but I'll bury the hatchet
Can we just pretend that this never happened? Yeah

Every little thing is reminding me of you
Guess I'll set fire to my whole room (Ah, ah, ah)

I don't want to let it show, but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?

So what are you doing tonight?
'Cause I miss you and I, and I can't even lie, I need you
I could get on a flight, I could make up the time
I know I'm out of line, can I see you?

I don't want to let it show, but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?
Baby, how do I let you go if I don't want to?
How do I let you go if I don't want to? Got me feeling like the elephant
In every room I'm walking into, yeah
We started out innocent
'Til I got pulled right into your issue, yeah

I'm tired of sending hugs and kisses, oh
I'm tired of all your burning bridges

It's like, damn
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
I was really rooting for ya, yeah (I was rooting for ya)
I was really rooting for ya, yeah yeah (I was, I was rooting for ya)
It's like, man
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
I was really rooting for ya (I was rooting for ya)
We were really rooting for ya, yeah-eh, yeah (Rooting for, rooting for ya)

I was rooting for ya, I was rooting for ya

Now I see you're having so much fun with everyone
You had so much fun making fun of
Did you go and bump your head?
Did you forget where you came from?

I'm tired of sending my well wishes
I'm tired of all your burning bridges, yeah

It's like, damn
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
I was really rooting for ya, yeah (I was rooting for ya)
I was really rooting for ya, yeah yeah (I was, I was rooting for ya)
It's like, man
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
I was really rooting for ya (I was rooting for ya)
We were really rooting for ya, yeah-eh, yeah (Rooting for, rooting for ya)

I'm not even brokenhearted (Uh-uh)
I'm just a little disappointed (Uh-uh)
What a shame, we coulda had a good thing
You let go of a good thing

It's like, damn
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
I was really rooting for ya, yeah yeah
I was really rooting for ya (Oh, I was really rooting for ya)
It's like, damn (Damn)
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
(In the summertime, in the summertime)
I was really rooting for ya, oh no (I was rooting for ya)
We were really rooting for ya, yeah yeah (Rooting for, rooting for ya)
(We were really rooting for ya)

It's like damn
Why you gotta be so cold?
(I was rooting for ya, I was rooting for ya)
Why you—
I was really, I was really rooting for ya I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

Tell me they love it, they want me, they need me
Surrounded inside of this room by the gritty
It seems like these women is needy
But all they've been wantin' and needin' is money
She callin' me honey, I know that she lyin'
And all she want from me is everything high end
The ladder, the ladder, she love it, she climbin' above it
The higher she gets, she gets no vision from it
The second she plummet she gon' be right here
The second she plummet she gon' be right here
At the bottom with killers and dealers
Now they say that diamonds forever but never explain
That the diamonds fillin' up your safe cannot fill up the pain
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here I, I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But, since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But, really I would rather be at
Home all by myself, not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner, under
Clouds of marijuana, with this
Boy who's hollering, I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out—

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the
Girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out—

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

If you're ready then I'm ready, yeah
If you're ready then I'm ready, yeah, yeah
If you're ready then I'm ready, yeah, yeah
If you're ready then I'm ready, yeah, yeah What happens to a flame when it burns out?
What happens to a love that's not new?
What happens when I'm no longer impressive?
Or when there's nothing left to learn about you?

See, I used to wonder 'bout you
What it would be like to love you
Now I've seen every hole in your heart
I'm used to loving slowly
But this time, you already know me
I hope you like all the broken parts

Oh, we can't run away from the comfortable
'Cause it's inevitable in love, in love
Oh it's time we make way for the comfortable
'Cause it's already comfortable in us, in us

They say the honeymoon is just a puppet show (Puppet show)
They say nobody really makes it through (Makes it through)
And though a part of me wishes that this was two July's ago
The rest of me is safer here with you

See, I used to wonder 'bout you
What it would be like to love you
But now I know you inside and out
I'm used to loving slowly
But it took you nothing to know me
What happens when I run out of parts? Yeah

Oh, I guess you could say that it's comfortable
And it's inevitable in love, in love
Oh, it's time we make way for the comfortable
'Cause it's already comfortable in us, in us

It turns out you think my favorite song's annoying
Turns out no one makes me sensitive like you
I used to be sad that the honeymoon's behind us
Until I realized that it means we made it through

Oh, we can't run away from the comfortable
'Cause it's inevitable in love (In love), in love (In love)
Oh, it's time we make way for the comfortable (For the comfortable)
'Cause it's already comfortable (It's already comfortable)
In us (In us), in us

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In the comfortable with you Do you recall the days at your old place?
Playing with Troll dolls to scare the kids away
My closet was a time machine, yours a stage
I wish we told those little girls they're gonna be okay
Still picture it all in my mind
Making a campfire out of broken flashlights
Jealous of your high tops 'cause someone stole mine
Wish somebody would've told me that we'd be alright

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget

Do you remember all the cartoons at midnight?
Like the one about the crass-humoured French guy
And what about you, Mr. Poetry?
And what about all that we built in just a couple weeks?
Talkin' 'bout all of our fears through a cracked screen
Picking little fights over falling asleep
I wish you knew I loved you when you knew you loved me
Really wish I knew you sooner than my 20s

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget

I'm a product of the who's, when's, and how's
Those who let go and those who stuck around
I wish somebody would've told me I'd be here now
'Cause this kind of life is one to sing about (Oh yeah)

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love, you won't ever forget

My kind of love you, won't ever forget
Wish somebody would've told me that would be alright All of my life I thought I was right
Looking for something new
Stuck in my ways like old-fashioned days
But all the roads led me to you

The house that you live in don't make it a home
But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
People in life, they will come and they'll leave
But if I had a choice I know where I would be

Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
At the end of the day, I choose you

Now I found the strength to make a change
And look at the magic I found
No matter the name or where you came from
'Cause no one has much figured out

The house that you live in don't make it a home
But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
I finally found where I feel I belong
And I know you'll be there with wide open arms

Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
At the end of the day, I choose you
I choose you

Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light

Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
At the end of the day, I choose you
Oh, I choose you
I choose you Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da,  da-da-da-da, da
Da-da,  da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da (Okay)

My best friend said to me, ""I know just what we need
A  song of yours that we could feel ourselves to""
I  said it'd be a test 'cause you know I'm always stressed
Come to think of it, I guess I've never cared to

She  said, ""You won't know if you never commit""
So here's me convincing myself I'm the shit

I'm a million trick pony
The number one and only
On  a scale of 1 to 10, I'm at 11
Okay, okay
Turn pain into a paycheck
Should see me in a sundress
I do it all with ease, I should give lessons
Okay, okay, okay

Maybe if I write it down, I'll make it real somehow
'Cause everyone's allowed to feel amazing

And I'll never know if I never commit
So here's me convincing myself I'm the shit

I'm a million trick pony
The number one and only
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm at 11
Okay, okay
Turn pain into a paycheck
Should see me in a sundress
I do it all with ease, I should give lessons
Okay, okay, okay

Fake it until I make it ring true
One day, I'ma be better at feelin' cool, yeah
Fake it until I make it ring true, ayy
One day, I'ma be better at feelin' like a

Million trick pony
The number one and only
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm at 11
Okay, okay
Turn pain into a paycheck
Should see me in a sundress
I do it all with ease, I should give lessons
Okay, okay, okay Choose your weapon, and let's go
Who's gonna beat this level?
I speed up, you slow down
Looks like I'm on your tail now
Another round, do we give up?
This is taking longer than Zelda
Hold on, what I meant was
Is it too late to get a 1-up?

Baby, baby, baby, this is getting too crazy
I don't have the training
Baby, baby, baby, this love ain't a game
So we should stop playing

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up, but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
But nobody wins

Nobody wins
Nobody, nobody wins
But no-, but the game goes on

All the trash talk is getting real old
I'd rather try my hand at Rainbow Road
I'm focused, play my next move
But you're onto me, so it's no use
It's a showdown, a game for two
Pick each other's brains looking for clues
A battle with no objective
Who will be the final one standing?

Baby, baby, baby, this is getting too crazy
I don't have the training
Baby, baby, baby, this love ain't a game
So we should stop playing

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up, but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
But nobody wins

Nobody wins

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck, 'cause right now nobody's safe

Push and shove, go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up, but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
But nobody wins There's yelling in the hallway
I found refuge on a twin bed of this three-star hotel
I hear the laughter from the TV
Static, Rachel talks to Phoebe about the cat that smells
And I know this place is haunted, oh
I swear I hear somebody knocking, but I can't really tell

And this outlet's busted
Phone died, and I can't charge it
What a life, man, what a life this is, mmm

Just me, myself, and nothing
But I taught me how to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah ah

I remember I owe mom a call
As I hang my stray hairs on the shower walls for decoration
I wonder what I'd hear if rooms could talk
And I wonder why I'm thinking that at all
I'm going crazy

And this toilet's rusted
Food came, but I don't trust it
What a life, man, what a life this is, yeah

Just me, myself and nothing
But I taught me how to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah ah

Hard to sleep sometimes with no one by my side
I do my best to find the sense in it
The more the days go by, the more myself and I
Shake hands and realize the benefits of independence

And it's really something
To make homes of worn-out luggage
What a life, man, what a life this is, yeah

Just me, myself and nothing
But somehow I've learned to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah
Home is wherever I live
Ah, ah, ah ah
Home is wherever I live St. Nick don't exist anymore
And Oz was just a lonely man
It’s so damn hard to believe in anything again
Wise is the optimist
But truth is I don't understand
Haven't figured out much of anything

But strange world
Strange world, strange world

’Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don't
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it’s all out of our control
All we know is that we don’t

Is this all there is?
Preachers and rocket ships
Have never quite made any sense of it yet
Paul says, ""Let it be""
But the other said, ""The test is key""
I say, ""Where's the line between real and fantasy?""

In this strange world
Strange world, strange world, hey

’Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don’t
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

All we know is that we don't
We don't, we don't
Strange world, strange world, strange world, whoa oh

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes (Yeah yeah yeah)
We try to help it but we won't (We won't)
All we know is that we don't (Yeah)
'Round and 'round and 'round we go (We go)
The chips will fall, and so it goes (And so it goes)
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

Strange, strange, strange world
Strange world Hahaha, Eazy

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

So don't get it mixed up
It's been my story, It's never switched up
And I never kissed up
So fuck the world then I got my dick sucked
Try and say I'm too wild
Did my own thing so fuck the cool crowd
Late nights with the music too loud
I made it this far, now ma's just too proud
So if you don't like me
Cause I'm an asshole, well fuck, I might be
I was raised in the land of hyphy
World looked different as far as I see
I'm doing me, don't mind me
Only one time I'mma tell you kindly
Please fuck off, I don't need you by me
But if you search then you know where to find me
Eazy

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are ""Hey, girl with the empty eyes
Open up, you know you look prettier when you smile
Look around, it's a decent life
You feel too much, pick up your feet and make use of your time""

They sure know how to talk up a storm
Rain down on your pity parade
Trying to find the cure
Bask in your distress a little bit more
’Cause a sad face don't go away that easy

Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to shut ’em up
There ain't a rush to recover
'Cause it's easier said, it's easier said than
Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to make 'em stop
Just take your time to recover
'Cause it’s easier said, it’s easier said than done

""Hey, boy with the painted frown
Listen up, shake off the cloud that follows you around
Think fast, change your mood, and be approachable
Man up, crawl your way up off the ground""

They sure know how to talk up a storm
Rain down on your pity parade
Thinking they found the cure
Bask in your distress a little bit more
'Cause a sad face don’t go away that easy, no

Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to shut 'em up
There ain't a rush to recover
’Cause it's easier said, it's easier said than
Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to make 'em stop
Just take your time to recover
'Cause it's easier said, it's easier said than done

So what if you're a bit bitter before you recharge?
I mean, I spend my days complaining to a guitar
Remember, everyone is coping with their own scars
And just a little bit of time can get you so far, yeah

Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to shut 'em up (No, no, no)
There ain't a rush to recover
'Cause it's easier said, it's easier said than
Healing and patience are lovers (Healing and patience are lovers)
Don't place the blame on your heart just to make 'em stop (Make 'em stop)
Just take your time to recover (No, no)

Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
(It's easier said, it's easier said than done)
Done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
(It's easier said, it's easier said than done)
Done, done, done Never have I ever been someone who's had it all
Like, not at all, yeah
And, on occasion, I can think too much
I get uncomfortable, hide behind my walls
And I talk in circles, but at least I say what I mean
And I rock my heart on the sleeve of my T-shirt

So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, everything
And no, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget me, no
No, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget this girl next door
No, no, no, no

Never have I ever met someone who worries like I do
That's nothing new, yeah
And I don't really like to get dressed up
What's it to you? I know what I can do
And I'm not Bowie, Prince or Queen
But at least I do what I dream
And I rock my soul on both sleeves of my T-shirt

So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, everything
And no, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget me, no
No, you won't, no, you won't
Forget, forget this girl next door

And I may not be a genius
I'm just a girl with some reasons to stay Plain Jane
But I won't go 'til you hear me
I'll be sure not to leave 'fore you know my name

So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, yeah
No, you won't (You won't)
No, you won't (You won't)
Forget (Forget), forget me no
No, you won't (You won't)
No, you won't (You won't)
Forget, forget this girl next door Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da

Almost made me lose my cool for a minute
Almost forgot who I am for minute
Almost forgot that you should count all your lucky stars
That you ever even had me for a minute (Woo)

I mind my business and I still get burned (Still get burned)
But it's only painful if I let it hurt (Let it hurt)
Go ahead and fill up all your voids with parts of her
I won't be holding my breath

You said, ""I'm happy that I found you"" (Happy that I found you)
But, boy, you went in for the kill (For the kill)
You said, ""I've never, ever, ever met a girl like you"" (Boy)
And, boy, you never will (Never will, never will)
Boy, you never will

Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da (Woo)

No one's gonna see you and hear you and feel you quite as well
Don't tell me you can't tell
How can you notice what a real thing is
If you don't even know yourself? Yeah

Go mind your Ps and Qs, I'll mind my own (Mind my own)
But don't you come knocking when you're alone (You're alone)
'Cause I have been pushed as far as I can go
And I won't hold my breath

You said, ""I'm happy that I found you"" (Happy that I found you)
But, boy, you went in for the kill (For the kill)
You said, ""I've never, ever, ever met a girl like you"" (Boy)
And, boy, you never will (Never will, never will)
Boy, you never will

You won't get any of my tears, no, not this time
Lucky for you, I have been hurt enough to know I'll be fine

I mind my business and I still get burned
I'm too young to care, too old to let it hurt
I am not a second choice if I'm not the first
So don't hold your breath

You said, ""I'm happy that I found you,"" yeah (Happy that I found you)
But, boy, you went in for the kill (For the kill)
You said, ""I've never, ever, ever met a girl like you"" (Boy)
And, boy, you never will (Never will, never will)
Said, boy, you never will (Never will, never will)
Boy, you never will (Da-da, da-da, da-da) Poured out my heart last night
Wrote a song with some good lines
I spill my feelings on you sometimes
But at least you know
Had a one-way talk with your voicemail
Called out, but you weren't there and
Now you're back and it's not fair
What you're doing

You say you thought about me all along
(Say you thought about me)
But never said a thing till I was gone (Ah)

How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I don't have a crystal ball
I can't see through your walls
You should know better
How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I'm tired of cracking codes
If you want me, let me know
You should know better
Ah, better

You bottle it up like fine wine
But don't rely on the grapevine
I always fall for the shy guy
What was I expecting?
So lay it all out on the table
You felt it, but you never said so
Even Juliet and Romeo couldn't outsmart communication

If you don't wanna talk, that's fine by me
(You don't want to talk, that's fine, fine by me)
But don't get mad when I get up and leave (Ah)

How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I don't have a crystal ball
I can't see through your walls
You should know better
How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I'm tired of cracking codes
If you want me let me know
You should know better
Ah, better

Speak now or forever hold your tongue
(You should know better, you should know better)
Speak now or forever hold your tongue
(You should know better, you should know better)

How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I don't have a crystal ball (Crystal ball)
I can't see through your walls
You should know better
How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I'm tired of cracking codes (Yeah)
If you want me let me know
You should know better
Ah, better (No, no, no, no, no, no, eh)

You should know better
You should know better
Speak now or forever, yeah
You should know better
You should know better These days, I'm my own best friend
I make my bed to lay in it again
Don’t know who to trust
And no time of the month can justify this

Blame it on the growing pains
Just blame it on the growing pains
Blame it on the growing pains
Or blame it on me?
Blame it on the growing pains
Just blame it on the growing pains
Blame it on the growing pains, yeah
Or blame it on me?
Just blame it on me?
Or do I blame it on me? You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely, but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true, woah-oh

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
(And baby, all I need for you to know is)
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is, yeah

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true, woah-oh

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you (To know is)
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
(Baby, all I need for you to know is)

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try
To tell me, me that you love me, oh, oh
Each and every single day
I know I'm gonna have to eventually
Give you away, yeah, yeah

And though my love is rare, rare, rare, rare
And though my love is true, yeah
Yeah, I'm just scared
That we may fall through-ough-ough-ough
Yeah

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to (Know is)
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
Baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
(I don't know where my soul is) Soul is
(I don't know where my home is)
And baby, all I need for you to know is
(I don't know where my soul is)
I don't know where my soul is
(I don't know where my home is)
I don't know where my home is J.R

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people, who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

So these are the places you go when you choose not to answer my text?
Pull up to Up & Down, whip out the phone for the Instagram flex
Click, click
She got a job for herself but I know how she spendin' them checks
And don't worry, mama, there's no need to stress
I'ma get my respect
I get that respect, it's no flex
But you trust me, I give 'em what's next
I ain't the prince when I'm in
But you know they be thinkin' I'm fresh
Oh, I sit in the cut in the club
But come home and be thinkin' I'm Will
But don't tell the MSFTS

Tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually, I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl, who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy, who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here

Oh-oh-oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here We were warm and wonderful
Once upon a time
But now we're frozen, hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead

Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say, ""Told you so""
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes

Darling, I know that our love is going cold

That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up

(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things could only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
Oh more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
Oh, oh

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Wait on me girl
And cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself, yeah

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it, oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Won't you just shut up, know you're my favorite
Am I...

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

Am I warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, baby, baby, yeah
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah, outside, outside
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, inside me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, inside
Is it warm enough outside?
Warm enough outside, inside
Is it warm enough outside?
Warm enough outside, inside
Is it warm enough? Is it warm enough? (Yeah) She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

There's a hope that's waiting for you
We're stars and we're beautiful Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I’m beautiful
Cause I wasn’t looking for love no
Nobody asked you to get me attached to you
In fact you tricked me
And I wasn’t trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that I’m asking
Is that you handle me with caution
Cause I don’t give myself often
But I guess I’ll try today

Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

I’m mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What’s wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, ohh
And I wasn’t trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn’t scared to fall again
But if you promise me you’ll catch me
Then it’s okay

Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming til I see you again
I’m not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I’m
Falling again
I've had bad luck with bad guys
I'm bad at deciding
Who i should confide in

Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours Find table spaces

So don't get it mixed up
It's been, my story's never switched up
And I never kissed up
So fuck the world then I got my dick sucked
Try and say I'm too wild
Did my own thing so fuck the cool crowd
Late nights with the music too loud
I made it this far, now ma's just too proud
So if you don't like me
Cause I'm an asshole, well fuck, I might be
I was raised in the land of hyphy
World looked different as far as I see
I'm doing me, don't mind me
Only one time, I'mma tell you kindly
Please fuck off, I don't need you by me
But if you search then you know where to find me

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd

Don't want a doll, no dinkey tinker toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use a dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what joy, what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinosauruses
I only likes hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me, too

Mom says a hippo, would eat me up but then
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian

There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what joy, what surprise

None of these girls you have proof of, don't ask why she looking like Rudolph
It's just a one time thing, don't worry ma, it's a one time thing
I'm still the same, promise I ain't changed, though I tried some drugs that I just can't name
You turn wrong to a beautiful piece in a room full of broken hearts

Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow
I came along

And all the things you do
And it was called yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so

Couple women by my side

Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh

Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell when it kicks in
I've been looking for a love
Thought I'd find it really boring
God make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you love me how

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

I'll be over here
I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best

We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

Me and Rozmanité
Pulled up to the party
Everyone’s drunk off their asses
They looking like zombies
RiCKY MØ$$ told me that it would be fun
But we just walked in and I’m already done
Would I do any girls here? How about none
But that girl over there
With the short dark hair
Nah yo back off, I don’t want a beer
Yo God why am I here?

Oh God why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none

I moved into the kitchen
So I could be hidden
This girl's telling me how these women are bitching
And that guys over there tryna get her pants
I wonder if maybe if we met by chance
I told her I’m a lost boy like Troye Sivan
I invited her over like girl c'mon
We can go back to my place and listen to Drake
I don’t even listen to this music they’ve been playing
My boys over there lighting blunts and blunts
All this smoke in the air so I had to jump
So I called my mom and told her ""Ma come get me yo
So I'll be over here""

Yo I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Scared to be beautiful I won't tell you I'm lonely
'Cause it may be selfish
I won't ask you to hold me
'Cause that won't mend what's helpless, mmm

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing for your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

I can't float in an ocean
That's already been drained
I won't cry at your feet now
I know my tears will fall in vain, mmm

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing for your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

No use wonderin'
Why your change in heart has wandered
So I'll ask you this question
'Cause it might help me sleep longer

Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you run out of love for me?

Out of love (Out of love)
Out of love (Out of love)
Out of love with me

         All of my life I thought I was right
Looking for something new
Stuck in my ways, like old-fashioned days
But all the roads led me to you

The house that you live in don't make it a home
But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
People in life, they will come and they'll leave
But if I had a choice I know where I would be

Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
At the end of the day, I choose you

Now I found the strength to make a change
And look at the magic I found
No matter the name or where you came from
'Cause no one has much figured out

The house that you live in don't make it a home
But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
I finally found where I feel I belong
And I know you'll be there with wide open arms

Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
At the end of the day I choose you

I choose you

Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side
There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
At the end of the day I choose you
Oh, I choose you I think it's safe to say that you will always change
New colours day-to-day; my friend, you are a hurricane
The look on your face, all the things you say
Send me to outer space; my friend, you test my patience

Don't you just push me out now
You got me into this mess, who's gonna get me out?
Why are you pulling me down
If you got things to figure out?

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me, yeah, no no
Go steady your, your heavy heart until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, you're ready for

Why do I care so much about you? Boy, you know I do
I think a million thoughts, but only half get through to you
You start a million fires just to see what they can do
But then you freeze up like winter season in June
I wanna climb into your mind and turn on all the lights
Read all your secrets, see if you wonder about mine
We're just kids tryin' to understand the world
You're still only a boy who's scared of a good girl

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me, no no
Go steady your, your heavy heart until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, you're ready for me

I won't be waiting for you to come around, to come around
I won't be waiting for you, but I'll be around, I'll be around

Don't you just push me out now
You got me into this mess, who's gonna get me out?
Why are you pulling me down
If you still got things to figure out?

Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Ready for me, no
Oh, you're not ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
No, no, no
Go steady your, your heavy heart
Until you're free
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Until you're ready, you're ready for me
Ready for me
Until you're ready for, ready for, ready for, ready for me
Ready for me

But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room

I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Tell my friends that I'll be over here
I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh here

Tell my friends that I'll be over here
I ask myself, what am I doin' here? She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause cover-girls don't cry
After their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful

And she has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, ""Cover-girls eat nothing""
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
""What's a little bit of hunger?
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Ah, oh, ah, ah oh
So to everyone who's hurting
Let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, we're beautiful

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful Almost made me lose my cool for a minute
Almost forgot who I am for minute
Almost forgot that you should count all your lucky stars
That you ever even had me for a minute (Woo)

I mind my business and I still get burned
But it's only painful if I let it hurt
Go ahead and fill up all your voids with parts of her
I won't be holding my breath

You said, ""I'm happy that I found you""
But boy, you went in for the kill
You said, ""I've never, ever, ever met a girl like you""
And, boy, you never will
Boy, you never will

Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da

No one's gonna see you and hear you and feel you quite as well
Don't tell me you can't tell
How can you notice what a real thing is
If you don't even know yourself? Yeah

Go mind your Ps and Qs, I'll mind my own
But don't you come knocking when you're alone
'Cause I have been pushed as far as I can go
And I won't hold my breath

You said, ""I'm happy that I found you""
But boy, you went in for the kill
You said, ""I've never, ever, ever met a girl like you""
And, boy, you never will
Boy, you never will

You won't get any of my tears; no, not this time
Lucky for you, I have been hurt enough to know I'll be fine

I mind my business and I still get burned
I'm too young to care, too old to let it hurt
I am not your second choice if I'm not the first
So don't hold your breath

You said, ""I'm happy that I found you""
But boy, you went in for the kill
You said, ""I've never, ever, ever met a girl like you""
And, boy, you never will
Boy, you never will
Boy, you never will, da-da
(Girl, that's good, I like that!) You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as charming as a cactus
You're as cuddly as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
No, I wouldn't touch you, with a
Thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an apalling dump heap overflowing
With the most disgraceful assortment of rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled up knots
Ew Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, now don't you overreact
So I just hold my breath, don't know why
I can't see the sun when young should be fun

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don’t know if I even care for ""grown"" if it's just alone, yeah

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-it-all
Can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains

Hey, hey, hey yeah, hey yeah (oh yeah)
Hey, hey, hey yeah, hey yeah
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night Poured out my heart last night
Wrote a song with some good lines
I spill my feelings on you sometimes
But at least you know
Had a one-way talk with your voicemail
Called out, but you weren't there and
Now you're back and it's not fair
What you're doing

You say you thought about me all along
But never said a thing till I was gone

How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I don't have a crystal ball
I can't see through your walls
So you should know better
How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I'm tired of cracking codes
If you want me, let me know
You should know better

You bottle it up like fine wine
But don't rely on the grapevine
I always fall for the shy guy
What was I expecting?
So lay it all out on the table
You felt it, but you never said so
Even Juliet and Romeo couldn't outsmart communication

If you don't wanna talk, that's fine by me
But don't get mad when I get up and leave

How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I don't have a crystal ball
I can't see through your walls
So you should know better
How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
I'm tired of cracking codes
If you want me, let me know
You should know better
Better

Speak now or forever hold your tongue
You should know better, you should know better
Speak now or forever hold your tongue
You should know better, you should know better

How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
A crystal ball
You should know better
How am I supposed to know what's on your mind?
Cracking codes, yeah, let me know
You should know better
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, eh

You should know better
You should know better
Speak now or forever, yeah
You should know better
You should know better 5 AM, the moon went to sleep
Your friend speakin' in tongues in the back seat
Just one little glance, I know what you mean somehow
We're stealin' moments, moments away
Why are we just not as good in the day?
Is it too soon to know if it's too soon to say for now?

The bubble we're livin' in
Settin' me free again
I don't know what it is about this

I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done

I can't feel my hands, you laugh like you do
It happened like that according to you
It's only a month, but doesn't feel new somehow
Yeah-eh, yeah

Bubble we're livin' in
Setting me free again
I don't know what it is about this

I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss
I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when

Paint a picture in my brain, encapsulate the fleetin' feelin'
It ricochets, replace my pain till every trace is leavin'
The nerve of autumn time, days flyin' by, every sunrise healin' me
And we're okay, we'll live this way till it's done
Ooh

I'm gonna miss this when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss
I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October, yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done

Mmm
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party; I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up-

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and listen
To music with a message
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can…

Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
Holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people if they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here, yeah

Ready, I'm ready, yeah
If you're ready, then I'm ready, yeah
If you're ready, then I'm ready, yeah Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end

A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, now don't you overreact
So I just hold my breath, don't know why
I can't see the sun when young should be fun (Fun)

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right

My best friend said to me, ""I know just what we need
A song of yours that we could feel ourselves to""
I said it'd be a test 'cause you know I'm always stressed
Come to think of it, I guess I've never cared to

She said, ""You won't know if you never commit""
So here's me convincing myself I'm the shh

I'm a million trick pony
The number one and only
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm at 11

Should see me in a sundress
I do it all with ease, I should give lessons
Okay, okay, okay

Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da

Maybe if I write it down, I'll make it real somehow
'Cause everyone's allowed to feel amazing

Starting to look like Ms. Know-it-all
Can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains

'cause still the growing pains, they're keeping me up tonight
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause CoverGirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
The way you are, just the way you are
Oh-oh the way you are, just the way you are
Oh-oh the way you are, just the way you are
Oh-oh the way you are, just the way you are
There's a hope, ah ah ah, there's a hope
There's a hope, ah ah ah, there's a hope
There's a hope, ah ah ah, there's a hope
There's a hope, ah ah ah, there's a hope
The way you, the way you are

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, CoverGirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing

There's a hope, ah ah ah, there's a hope Find table spaces, say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we’re pioneers, we make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin', there are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now, we’ll rebel-rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves
So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we’ll be alright, don’t mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don’t mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in-crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They’re not cooler than we are
So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)
We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way (say hey, hey, hey)
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
Let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)

 flights, 35 nights
29 creeps to the mind
Spend it all lost in the ridin the TO vibe, OT ridin
Flowers pretty in the sun
Are you missin' on the run
I'll be reminiscing on the front
Just a couple day one's trying to hit a homerun yeah
Grow fast  baby
Want to get away, elevate, celebrate
Make time for the movies and the lemonade
Cartoons, blues clues and some better days
We can't rewind time
The fine lines and guidelines
To finish last the sidelines

And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no band-aids for the growing pains Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, ""Now, don't you overreact""
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
Keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don’t know if I even care for ""grown"" if it's just alone, yeah

And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
Keeping me up at night

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
