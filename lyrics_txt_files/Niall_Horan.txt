"(Woo)

We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinkin' 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me

Your plans and those
Slow hands (Woo)
Slow hands

Fingertips puttin' on a show

Fingertips puttin' on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

Slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands (Woo)
Slow hands
Woo, slow hands Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you Waiting here for someone
Only yesterday, we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of?

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
To tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

Someone's moving outside
The lights come on down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don’t it feel fucked up we're not in love?

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
To tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask? When you feel your love's been taken
When you know there's something missing
In the dark, we're barely hangin' on
Then you rest your head upon my chest
And you feel like there ain't nothin' left
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

When you lay there and you're sleepin'
Hear the patterns of your breathin'
And I tell you things you've never heard before
Asking questions to the ceilin'
Never knowing what you're thinkin'
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

And I want this to pass
And I hope this won't last
Last too long

Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around, you disappear

I wanna blow your mind, just come with me, I swear
I'm gonna take you somewhere warm, you know j'adore la mer
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around, you disappear

(I got love for you)
(I got love for you)
Nice to meet ya
(I got love for you)
(I got love for you)

Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat ya to a drink

I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
And every time I turn around, you disappear

(I got love for you)
(I got love for you)
Nice to meet ya
(I got love for you)
(I got love for you)

One minute, you're there, the next one, you're gone
Been waiting for you all night, so come on
You know what I need, you know what I want
You know what I need now
You know what I need now

Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat ya to a drink

Nice to meet ya

Where ya been?
(I got love for you)
Let me treat ya
(I got love for you)
To a drink
(I got love for you)
Nice to meet ya We fight, we get high holdin' on to love
We came down 'cause there was nothing holdin' us
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
So, darlin'

Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

We wrote and we wrote
'Til there were no more words
We laughed and we cried
Until we saw our worst
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
Will someone

Put a little love on me? Ayy
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

Last night I lay awake
Stuck on the things we say
And when I close my eyes
The first thing I hear you say is

Put a little love on me, ayy
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up we're the only ones dancing
I look around and you're standing there asking
You say, ""You're the only one I need
So put your love on me""

You're the only one I need
Put your love on me I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming for you)

She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming for you)

She'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
Then trade you in for something new
I know what it's like, I fell for it twice
And now I'm just warning you

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
She's on the loose That first night, we were standin' at your door
Fumblin' for your keys, then I kissed you
Ask me if I wanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night
Then you took my hand and I followed you

Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind
We're sixty-five and you ask
When did I first know, I always knew

And I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

And I want the world to witness when we finally say ""I do""
It's the way you love, I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons
But at night, when I close my eyes

I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another (Never be)
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

And there'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life I swear there was lightnin' comin' from your eyes
Startin' a fire in our hotel room
And yeah, we were dancin', dancin' to Bruno
And I couldn't turn away from you
Yeah, I saw you smilin', breakin' the silence
Tellin' me just what you want
There in the moment, I was reminded
I haven't felt this way in a while

Blinded by the sparks
We were drivin' around in the dark
Findin' reasons to stay where we are

All of my life, I've been sleepwalk livin'
Runnin' around the same bars I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me

Yeah, it was magic
You were a vision, watchin' the way your body moves
You're takin' your clothes off, you look in the mirror
Tellin' me just what you want

And I was blinded by the sparks
I was holdin' you close in the dark
Findin' reasons to stay where we are

All of my life, I've been sleepwalk livin'
Runnin' around the same bars I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me

You, that's what I've been missin'
Was tangled up and twisted
Now, all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty
You, that's what I've been missin'
Was tangled up and twisted
Now, all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty

But it feels different when you're with me
It feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
It feels different when you're with me She closed the door
She hides behind the face nobody knows
She feels her skin touch the floor
She wants to fight
Her eyes are tired, nobody's on her side
She wants to feel like she did before

She looks into her mirror
Wishing someone could hear her, so loud
And I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough

I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough to feel my body come alive
When my bones start breaking, my heart starts shaking
I need love, need love

The coffee's cold
He turned around and said ""I hope you know
You're beautiful, have you ever been told?""
She's a little shy
As he walks away, she slowly breaks a smile
The skies are blue, haven't been for a while

She looks into her mirror
Wishing someone could hear her, so loud

I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough to feel my body come alive
When my bones starts breaking, my heart starts shaking
I need love, need love

Oh, oh woah
Oh, oh woah
She closed the door
She hides behind the face nobody knows
She feels her skin touch the floor

I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough to feel my body come alive
When my bones starts breaking, my heart starts shaking
I need love, need love
Oh, oh woa
Oh, oh woa In this house of broken hearts
We made our love out of stacks of cards
And yes, we tried to hold on tight
'Cause we knew our love was hard to find

And our paper houses reach the stars
'Til we break and scatter worlds apart
Yeah, I paid the price and own the scars
Why did we climb and fall so far?

We held our cards, built them high
But way too close to the light
So turn your head and let us go
I learned to breathe on my own

And our paper houses reach the stars
'Til we break and scatter worlds apart
Yeah, I paid the price and own the scars
Why do we climb and fall so far?

Yeah, our paper houses reach the stars
'Til we break and scatter worlds apart
I don't wanna lose your touch
I don't wanna hurt this much
I can feel you slipping away

Yeah, I paid the price and own the scars
Why do we climb and fall so far?

Why do we climb to fall so far? Everybody's got somebody
I just wanna be alone
Well, I don't need no one
Have too much fun
Out here on my own

I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead, yeah

'Long came the devil, caught my eye
She's kind of my type
Chelsea baby, drives me crazy
Oh, but there's one thing on my mind

I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And if you ask me around
And I should decline
Don't take it to heart
Your company's fine
But I get on better with mine
(Ooo, Ooo, Ooo)
Everybody's got somebody
I just wanna be alone

I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead, yeah
Well, I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead I've got a young heart
And it's wild and free
I don't know where it starts
But it ends with you and me
It's a hard road
As far as I can see
I don't know where I'm going
But I'll get back to you and me
'Cause we're two kids
Trying to start a fight
No matter where we go
Yeah, we'll be alright
All I'm asking for
A bit of patience, please
'Cause I know what's to come
And it's coming for you and me

Time has never been on our side
So would you wait for me?
I lead a selfish life
'Cause that's what I need
What do I have to do
To make you believe?
It's all for you and me


From a distance
I can hear you cry
But don't you worry, darlin'
Don't lose sleep tonight
I can promise it
I can guarantee
That at the end of the road
I see you with me

Time has never been on our side
So would you wait for me?
I lead a selfish life
'Cause that's what I need
What do I have to do
To make you believe?
It's all for you and me


When I look down the line
At the man I wanna be
I've always known from the start
That it ends with you and me Barefoot and a bottle of wine
You can stay with me tonight
You don't have to change when I'm around ya
So go ahead and say what's on your mind, on your mind

When you're with me, no judgement
You can get that from anyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

I get us breakfast in the mornin'
Or you can slip out in the night
You don't have to give me a warnin'
'Cause we both got nothin' to hide, nothin' to hide

Even though we don't talk for a couple of months, yeah
It's like we didn't lose any time
I could be your lover or your shoulder to cry on
You can be whoever you like, oh

When you're with me, no judgement
You can get that from anyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

I hope we never change
Even though we both know that we'll move on again
I'll keep your secrets safe
Until the time we both find ourselves alone again, oh

When you're with me, no judgement (No judgement)
You can get that from everyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement (No judgement)
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm (Yeah), when you're with me, no judgement
Mmm (Oh), we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement My mind is complicated
Find it hard to rearrange it
But I'll have to find a way somehow
Overreacting lately
Find it hard to say I'm sorry
But I'll make it up to you somehow
I just don't know why
Stars won't shine at night

Tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

Did I miscalculate this?
Let's just go back to basics
Forget about what's come and gone
'Cause I hate to see us like this
Breaking up on nights just like this
We should be shooting for them stars of gold

So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Then I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright
Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright

So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you Like the rain on a sunny day
There's a shadow behind your face
Tell me what you're running from
I don't know what made you so afraid
Don't you know you got the best of me?
Yeah, you're everything I want

Anyone can see
Anyone can see
You're hiding, hiding
You can talk to me
It's more than skin-deep
But I'm trying, yeah

Since we're alone
Yeah, you can show me your heart
If you put it all in my hand
No, I swear
No, I won't break it apart
Since we're alone
Show me all that you are
And if you get lost in the light
It's okay, I can see in the dark

All your thoughts running through your head
The things you think better left unsaid
Just wanna know where you came from
Why would you wanna play someone else?
I love you best when you're just yourself
Yeah, you're everything I want

Anyone can see
Anyone can see
You're hiding, hiding
You can talk to me
It's more than skin-deep
But I'm trying, yeah

Alone She's been lookin' at me all night
I'm terrified, I know why, baby
She's got the wrong crazy
Oh, I see the moon in her eyes
I'm paralyzed, she's not my baby
She's got the wrong crazy

Like wolves, we run wild, let passion get too much
Let ourselves get burned by the fire
We're walking on wire, but nothin' feels higher
When I see that look in your eyes

Tell me what you want because you know I want it too
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way

Turn around, she walkin' to me
I can't believe she's not my baby
Won't someone come see me?
Oh, you see the fool in my mind
Can't run and hide with your stare on me
Look what you're doing to me

I wanna run wild, let passion get too much
Let ourselves get burned by the fire
We're walking on wire, but nothin' feels higher
When I see that look in your eyes (Ayy, ayy)

Tell me what you want because you know I want it too
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way

Just say nothing
Oh, oh, small talk
Just say nothing
Oh, no

Like wolves, we run wild, let passion get too much
Let ourselves get burned by the fire, yeah

Tell me what you want because you know I want it too
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way
Tell me what you want because you know I want it too (You know I want it too)
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room (Straight up to your room)
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way

Just say nothing, oh, oh
Oh, oh, small talk (If you want it)
Just say nothing (You can have it, yeah)
Oh, no, small talk Oh no, get ready
I feel it coming, it's coming again
I stay close, hold steady
'Cause I don't want it, don't want it to end
Those brown eyes, crying in a crowded bar
Every time we get this close
It's always pulling us apart

Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
I just want a safe place to hide us away
So don't let the tide come and take me
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
Far from with you, where I wanna stay
So don't let the tide come and take me

Oh no, get ready
I feel it coming, it's coming again
Don't give up, and don't let me
'Cause I'm needing you to understand
When I go, all I ever seem to fear
Is that you're gonna find someone
And slowly watch me disappear

Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
I just want a safe place to hide us away
So don't let the tide come and take me
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
Far from with you, where I wanna stay
So don't let the tide come and take me

Oh no, get ready
Yeah, I feel it coming, it's coming again
Stay close and hold steady
'Cause I don't want it, don't want it to end
No, no, I don't want it, don't want it to end

Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
I just want a safe place to hide us away
So don't let the tide come and take me
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
Far from with you, where I wanna stay
So don't let the tide come and take me You keep saying that you're alright
But I can see it through your fake smile, you're not
There's a reservoir in your eyes
That you've been holding back a long time, what's wrong?

Darling, you don't have to hold it
You don't have to be afraid
You can go ahead and unload it
'Cause you know it'll be okay
Fire away
Fire away

Hold me close but at a distance
Thinking I don't ever listen, but I do
I know sometimes it gets confusing
You might be lost but I ain't losing you

Darling, you don't have to hold it
You don't have to be afraid
You can go ahead and unload it
'Cause you know it'll be okay
Fire away, hm
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away

And I will steady your hand
When you're losing your grip
Even if I don't understand
You can talk to me
And I will steady your hand
When you're losing your grip
And even if I don't understand
You can talk to me
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away Dear patience
Can we share a drink and let go of the pressure?
Dear patience
'Cause the last time that we talked seems like forever
And ever

Feels like you don't even know me
Just me and the stars can get lonely

Hey, can you show your face?
Can you see that I'm anxious?
Can you hear what I'm saying, saying?
Hey, 'cause I fall too fast
And I go down blazing
Can you hear what I'm saying?

Dear patience
If I pour my heart out, can you keep a promise? (Mmm, mmm)
'Cause the situation
Is like a mountain that's been weighing on my conscience
If I'm being honest

Feels like you don't even know me (Don't even know me)
Just me and the stars can get lonely

Oh, hey, can you show your face?
Can you see that I'm anxious?
Can you hear what I'm saying, saying?
Hey, 'cause I fall too fast
And I go down blazing
Can you hear what I'm saying?

The way you make time disappear
I hope that I find you, my dear
The way you make time disappear
I hope that I find you, my dear

Patience
Can we share a drink and let go of the pressure? Oh, oh
Dear patience
'Cause the last time that we talked seemed like forever
And ever

Hey, can you show your face? (Show your face)
Can you see that I'm anxious?
Can you hear what I'm saying, saying?
Hey, 'cause I fall too fast (Fall too fast)
And I go down blazing
Can you hear what I'm saying?

Dear patience I never thought that I would find out
We were just lovers in the dark
You've known someone for a long time
But you never really know who they are
It feels like it was only last week
I was trippin' right into your heart
If we're not gonna do this honestly
Baby, won't you give me back what you took apart?

When I was on my knees in the darkness
Yeah, you'd be there to break my fall
But now, I'm lyin' here so helpless
But somehow, I just still want more

You left me with nothing
Now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
But why do I think of you?
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing

I chase an old love just to feel loved
But it gave me nothin' that was real
No matter what I give, it's not enough
But I guess I'm holdin' onto you still

When I was on my knees in the darkness
Yeah, you'd be there to break my fall
But now, I'm lyin' here so helpless
But somehow, I just still want more

You left me with nothing
Now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
But why do I think of you?
Yeah, you left me with nothing
Now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing

Standin' out in the crowd
Nobody can hear me now
I'm tryna get over you
Standin' out in the crowd
If only you could see me now
I'm tryna get over you

You left me with nothing
And now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
Why do I think of you?
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing
You left me with nothing, yeah
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing
You left me with nothing It's your world I wanna live in
It's your ocean I wanna swim in
It's your show and I'm just watchin'
Losin' you is not an option

If you leave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight

Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind, oh
Tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild, oh
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

You keep talkin', I'll just listen
Daydreamin' 'bout where your lips been
Pull my heart right out my chest, drive a train through
Still get up and forgive you

If you leave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight

Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind, oh, yeah
Tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild, oh
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

I want you, there's no lie
I'll love you or die tryin'
I want you, there's no lie
I'll love you or die tryin'
Oh woah, oh, oh, oh I

Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind (Doesn't even cross your mind)
Yeah, tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild (Runnin' wild, oh)
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

Doesn't even cross your mind I just called to say that I miss you, babe
Wonder what you're doin' now
At your favourite place, you go and list the names
Is there one you're leavin' out?

I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper, you don't break them
But it hurts so bad the way you bend the rules

Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm

Someone makes you laugh, I can't help but ask
But you won't say what it's about
I pour myself a glass, it won't be the last
Just our medicine for now

I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper, you don't break them
But it hurts so bad the way you bend the rules

Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules

I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper, you don't break them
But it's just not fair the way you bend the rules

Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm Looking back through changes where we started from
Don't know about you but I knew it wasn't wrong
You know I kept a place for you in my mind
And I know you did the same 'cause you're just that kind

So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?
We've known it since we were young
So why did it take so long?
You know you make me feel loved
Make me feel like I'm home
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?

Moving on, you and I started looking back
Now we've got to make up for all the wasted time
You know I'd never let you just walk on by
From the day that I met you I knew you'd be mine

So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?
We've known since we were young
So why did it take so long?
You know you make me feel loved
Make me feel like I'm home
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?

Just started, just started
I'm having trouble believing it's true
Just started, just started
Now we got nothing to prove

So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?
We've known it since we were young
So why did it take so long?
You know you make me feel loved
Make me feel like I'm home
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?

Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long? You walk into the room, I go quiet
I catch your eyes and don't blink an eyelid
Feels like the world locked us on an island
An island without waves

I try and try to forget you
But your mother thinks I'm the best for you
Try and try to erase you
But you won't disappear

Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder, you're everywhere
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run, but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone
And my heart's under control
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere

The ground beneath my feet's a bit colder
I see your face in people I don't know
Feels like the world is twistin' in slo-mo
And I'm stuck in one place (Oh)

I try and try to forget you
But your mother thinks I'm the best for you
I try and try to erase you
But you won't disappear

Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder, you're everywhere
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run, but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone
And my heart's under control
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere I go
But you're still not here
And you're still not here

Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder, you're everywhere (Yeah)
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run, but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone (All alone)
And my heart's under control (Oh no)
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere
You're everywhere Standing here on our own
Yeah, the first step's the hardest when you're walking into the unknown
It's been dark, and it's been cold
Had my head in the clouds never knowing what lies down below

Then you spoke your truth with no secrets
Told me use your heart while it's beating

When you're right here beside me, there's nothing else I need
Your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach
When you're with me, it feels like I'm finally free
Feels like I'm finally free

I didn't know, didn't know what was real
Had to go to the edge and look down just to see how it feels

Then you spoke your truth with no secrets
Told me use your heart while it's beating

When you're right here beside me, there's nothing else I need
Yeah, your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach
When you're with me, it feels like I'm finally free
(Wo woo)
Feel's like I'm finally free

I used to spend the nights looking at the stars
Wondering how to get there, or is it just too far?
I used to spend the nights looking at the stars
Wondering how to get there, or is it just too far?

But when you're right here beside me there's nothing else I need
Yeah, your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach
It's easy to believe
When you're with me it feels like I'm finally free
Oh yeah
It feels like I'm finally free
(Wo woo)
It feels like I'm finally free Moon shining, sun rising
You're the one I want to wake up to
Lights fading, I'm changing
Overthinking, I don't know what to do

I wanna kiss you like the first time
Hold you like it's not goodbye
Wish I hadn't been so cruel
I wanna let all my defenses down
Scream until you hear me out
I'll lay it on the line for you

My mind's made up
Take me back, take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had would never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep, soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back, take me back

Drunk dialin', full dive in
Don't you tell me that it's too late now
'Cause I'm pacing, I keep breaking
Is there a way to make it up somehow?

I wanna kiss you like the first time
Hold you like it's not goodbye
Before you fall for somebody new
I wanna let all my defences down
Scream until you hear me out
I know that I'll be good to you

My mind's made up
Take me back, take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had would never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep, soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back, take me back

My mind's made up, up, up, up, up
My mind's made up

And take me back, take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had could never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep, soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back, take me back

And take me back, take me back
And take me back, take me back
Oh Too many hours in the night
Every second is about her
Every thought is wrapped around her
Too many feelings in the light
I just need a new distraction
And I like the way you're dancing

I'll give you what's left of me
'Cause you feel so heavenly
I don't know what's best for me
But maybe it's time

I need a new angel
A touch of someone else to save me from myself
I need a new angel
A touch I've never felt, baby, can you tell that
Each time I close my eyes, she's in there running wild
I'm hoping you get her out of my mind
I need a new angel
I need a new angel

I think I saw you in my dreams
Didn't know what I've been missing
'Til you walked in like a vision (Ooh)
You give me something out of reach
Just keep doing what you're doing
'Cause you move me when you're moving

I need a new angel
A touch of someone else to save me from myself
I need a new angel (I need a new one)
A touch I've never felt, but baby, can't you tell that
Each time I close my eyes, she's in there running wild
I'm hoping you get her out of my mind
I need a new angel
I need a new angel

I'll give you what's left of me, left of me
'Cause you feel so heavenly, heavenly
I'll give you what's left of me
'Cause you feel so heavenly
I don't know what's best for me
But maybe it's time

I need a new angel
A touch of someone else to save me from myself
I need a new angel
A touch I've never felt, but baby, can't you tell that
Each time I close my eyes, she's in there running wild
I'm hoping you get her out of my mind
I need a new angel (I need a new angel)
I need a new angel
Angel Maybe we are the champagne lovers
Lay in the dark, we are stargazing now
Well, I don't like it
Rolling the dice just to feel the thunder
Deep in the heart of a downward spiral
Falling, we're falling


We should twist the knife
Put it all to bed
I need to understand what it takes to love


So come on, love me when the lights burn low
Meet me underneath the sheets
'Cause you got a hold of me, baby
Enough to pull me back in deep
You used to love me when the lights burned low
Now we're tearing at the seams
We've both had enough of this, baby
So promise me that when you leave
You'll always say you'll come back to me


Maybe we are the perfect strangers
Only the stories left on paper, now
Well, I don't like it


We should twist the knife
Put it all to bed
I need to understand what it takes to love again


So come on, love me when the lights burn low
Meet me underneath the sheets
'Cause you got a hold of me, baby
Enough to pull me back in deep
You used to love me when the lights burned low
Now we're tearing at the seams
We've both had enough of this, baby
So promise me that when you leave
You'll always say you'll come back to me



Come back to me, Come back to me
You're gonna say you'll come back to me I keep staring at that little white number
You left here in the summer
Hanging in my wardrobe
Do you still want it?
Do you still want it?
I know that I did you the service
Of calling 'cause I'm nervous
I know that we don't talk
I know that it's on purpose
Do you still want it?

But I'm holding on

Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Or leave it out
Maybe it's time that I give you space
I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even if I don't want to, babe

I keep staring at that little white number
The one in the picture
When we lose our temper
You'd look at it for hours
But do you still want it?
You smile on the staircase and you open the door
Kissing on the couch
Make up in the drawer
Darling, do you still want it?

But I'm holding on

Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Or leave it out
Maybe it's time that I give you space
I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even if I don't want to, babe

La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
I know, you know, we both want it, babe
I know, you know, we both want it, babe

But I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even though I don't wanna, babe What holds me
When I'm alone?
What makes the tiger tame?
What turns the sky
From black to gold?
What sends my tears up in flames?

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

What moves me like a lightning bolt
While praising all my fears?
What breaks me?
Helps me understand
What makes me disappear?

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love

What do I, do I really want
In this stormy life?
What choices do I really have
With this heart of mine?

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love

Without your love
I'm jaded
Going crazy
Come save me
Heart's beating
Not breathing
I'm breathing

What holds me
When I'm alone?
What makes the tiger tame?
What turns the sky
From black to gold?
What sends my tears up in flames?

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love
Oh!
Nothing
Except for your love I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

But I know in my heart, you're not a constant star

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see, two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart, you're just a moving part

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your fool's gold

But I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels, that's not the way you feel

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your fool's gold Darlin', are you always tryin’ to blame me?
Is it me or 'cos you came here?
Just accept that time was wrong
Oooh, change thee
I've been thinkin’ bout it lately
We never finished what we started
Now I'm fearful that it's gone

Let's keep this open
There won't be any more hearts that are broken
Hold on, hold on

Don't leave me wastin' all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don’t leave it wasted

Someday, it could be more then we intended
And we’ll be happy that we waited
When it's all been said and done
Oooh, and you have changed me
And we both got what we wanted
And looking back it’s complicated
But we would've happened all along

So keep this open
There won't be any more hearts that are broken
Hold on, hold on

Don't leave me wastin’ all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don't leave me wasted

Don't leave me wastin' by myself
Let's leave emotions on the shelf
I swear there ain't nobody else
Don't leave me wasted
Don't leave me wasted

Don't leave me wastin' all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don't leave me wasted

Don't leave me wastin' all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don't leave me wasted

Don't leave me wastin' by myself
Let's leave emotions on the shelf
I swear there ain't nobody else
Don't leave me wasted Esperando aquí por alguien
Tan solo ayer estábamos encaminados
Me sonríes de vuelta a mi y tu rostro ilumina el sol
Ahora estoy esperando aquí por alguien

¿Y oh, amor, sientes esto rudo?
¿Porque eres sólo tu en quien pienso?

Mi sombra está bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazón tiene la esperanza
De que tú vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado aún
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
¿Acaso es pedir demasiado? (x2)

Alguien se esta moviendo fuera
Las luces se encienden y se apagan en el camino
Olvido que no estas aquí cuando cierro los ojos
¿Aún sigues pensando en mi a veces?

And oh, love, mira el sol mientras sale
No te sientas jodido, no estamos enamorados

Mi sombra está bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazón tiene la esperanza
De que tú vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado aún
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
¿Acaso es pedir demasiado?

Mi sombra está bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazón tiene la esperanza
De que tú vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado aún

Mi sombra está bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazón tiene la esperanza
De que tú vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado aún
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
¿Acaso es pedir demasiado?

Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
¿Acaso es pedir demasiado?
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
¿Acaso es pedir demasiado? We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
'Cause this is our house, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everybody who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force here to be my lover
And my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table (At every table) , I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover I have seen, seen it all in paper dreams
Watched it unfold on the screen
But I never understood
I have heard, have heard you speak a million words
Now you're talkin' to me first
I never thought you would

Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind

I was young, my heart was always on the run
But you make lovin' fun
I never knew it could be
Hey, I see you from a different point of view
Feels too good to be true
I found my missin' piece

Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no

Oh, my, my
When I look into your eyes
It's a sight I can't describe
Oh, I must be seein' blind

Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, I must be seein' blind When you feel your love's been taken
When you know there's something missing
In the dark, we're barely hangin' on
Then you rest your head upon my chest
And you feel like there ain't nothing left
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

When you lay there and you're sleeping
Hear the patterns of your breathing
And I tell you things you've never heard before
Asking questions to the ceiling
Never knowing what you're thinking
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

And I want this to pass
And I hope this won't last
Last too long

Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far... from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard...
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
Wish I was there with you now

As if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming for you)

She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming for you)

She'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
Then trade you in for something new
I know what it's like, I fell for it twice
And now I'm just warning you

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose
(She's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
She's on the loose We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinking 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those
Slow hands
Slow hands

I just wanna take my time
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those
Slow hands

Fingertips puttin' on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, you know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I tried
You don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change then our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
You say so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes, the echoes
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change then our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run

Seasons change then our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away Deberíamos seguir con esto en mi casa
Eso fue lo que ella me dijo directamente a la cara
Porque te deseo tanto
Sí, te deseo bebe
He estado pensando en ello todo el día
Y espero que tu te sientas del mismo modo
Porque te deseo tanto
Sí, te deseo bebe

Lentas, manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aquí sin ti encima mío
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Tus planes, y esas
Manos lentas
Manos lentas

Yo solo quiero tomarme mi tiempo
Podríamos hacer esto toda la noche bebe
Porque te deseo tanto
Sí, te deseo bebe

Lentas, manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aquí sin ti encima mío
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Tus planes, y esas
Manos lentas

Las puntas de los dedos hacen un espectáculo
Me tienes ahora y no puedo decir ""no""
Quiero estar contigo a solas
Llévame a casa, llévame a casa
Las puntas de los dedos hacen un espectáculo
¿Acaso no ves que te deseo, bebe?

Manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aquí sin ti encima mío
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aquí sin ti encima mío
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Aquellas manos lentas
Manos lentas Maybe we are the champagne lovers
Lay in the dark, we are stargazing now
Well, I don't like it
Rolling the dice just to feel the thunder
Deep in the heart of a downward spiral
Falling, we're falling

We should twist the knife
Put it all to bed, I
Need to understand what it takes to love again

So come on, love me when the lights burn low
Meet me underneath the sheets
‘Cause you got a hold of me baby, enough to pull me back in deep
You used to love me when the lights burned low
Now we're tearing at the seams
We've both had enough of this, baby, so promise me that when you leave
You'll always say you'll come back to me

Maybe we are the perfect strangers
Only the stories left on paper now
And I don't like it

We should twist the knife
Put it all to bed, I
Need to understand what it takes to love again

So come on love me when the lights burn low
Meet me underneath the sheets
Cause you got a hold of me baby, enough to pull me back in deep
You used to love me when the lights burned low
Now we're tearing at the seams
We've both had enough of this, baby, so promise me that when you leave
You'll always say you'll come back to me

Come back to me
You're gonna say you'll come back to me Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around

Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you You think that you'll die without her
You know that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Feel the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

Ain't no crying in the club
Hey, hey, let the beat carry 'way your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club
Hey, hey, with a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
Ain't no crying in the club

You may think that you'll die without him
But you know that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free

I got love, love I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laugh's on me
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the... I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear

Let me treat ya to a drink

Nice to meet ya, yeah
Where ya been?
Let me treat ya, yeah
To a drink
Nice to meet ya
Mmm, mmm Waiting here for someone
Only yesterday we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

Someone's moving outside
The lights come on and down the drive (drive, drive, drive, drive)
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don’t it feel messed up we're not in love

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret

My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time When I passed you in the doorway
Well you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance
Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should have been in by ten
Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
But it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the end

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

And I'm walking home
The last bus has long gone
But I'm dancing in the moonlight


Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night Waiting here for someone

The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands, yeah (woo)
Slow hands (woo)
Slow hands No, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
I'm gonna stand my ground
I won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
Hey, I
I will stand my ground
And I won't back down

Well, I know what's right
'Cause I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
Hey, I
I will stand my ground
And I won't back down


And I said hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
Hey, I
I will stand my ground
Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
Hey, I
Will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No, I won't back down
No, I won't back down I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's coming, she's coming (she's on the loose)
She's coming, she's coming for you

She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's coming, she's coming (she's on the loose)
She's coming, she's coming for you

She's on the loose, and she'll be making all the moves
She's on the loose, and she'll be making all the moves
She's on the loose, and she'll be making all the moves
She's on the loose

She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
She loves nobody else but you

She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's coming, she's coming (she's on the loose)
She's coming, she's coming for you Despertando para besarte y no hay nadie ahí
El olor de tu perfume todavía pegado en el aire
Es duro
Ayer creí haber visto tu sombra corriendo por ahí
Es curioso como las cosas nunca cambian es esta vieja cuidad
Tan lejos de las estrellas

Y quiero decirte todo
Las palabras que nunca llegué a decir la primera vez
Y recuerdo todo
Desde cuando éramos niños jugando en la feria
Desearía estar ahí contigo ahora

Si el mundo entero estuviera observando, seguiría bailando contigo
Conduciría carreteras y caminos para estar ahí contigo
Una y otra vez la única verdad
Todo vuelve a ti

Vi que te mudaste con alguien nuevo
En el pub que nos conocimos, él tiene sus brazos alrededor tuyo
Es tan duro
Tan duro

Y quiero decirte todo
Las palabras que nunca llegué a decir la primera vez
Y recuerdo todo
Desde cuando éramos niños jugando en la feria
Desearía estar ahí contigo ahora

Si el mundo entero estuviera observando, seguiría bailando contigo
Conduciría carreteras y caminos para estar ahí contigo
Una y otra vez la única verdad
Todo vuelve a ti
Tu aún me pones nervioso cuando caminas por la habitación
Las mariposas cobran vida cuando estoy cerca de ti
Una y otra vez la única verdad
Todo vuelve a ti
Y sé que está mal
Que no pueda pasar página
Pero hay algo en ti
Si el mundo entero estuviera observando, seguiría bailando contigo
Conduciría carreteras y caminos para estar ahí contigo
Una y otra vez la única verdad
Todo vuelve a ti
Tu aún me pones nervioso cuando caminas por la habitación
Las mariposas cobran vida cuando estoy cerca de ti
Una y otra vez la única verdad
Todo vuelve a ti
Todo vuelve a ti Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Back to you
Back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Everything comes back to you Barefoot and a bottle of wine
You can stay with me tonight
You don't have to change when I'm around ya
So go ahead and say what's on your mind, on your mind

When you're with me, no judgement
You can get that from anyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

I get us breakfast in the mornin'
Or you can slip out in the night
You don't have to give me a warnin'
'Cause we both got nothin' to hide, nothin' to hide

Even though we don't talk for a couple of months, yeah
It's like we didn't lose any time
I can be your lover or your shoulder to cry on
You can be whoever you like, oh

When you're with me, no judgement
You can get that from anyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

I hope we never change
Even though we both know that we'll move on again
I'll keep your secrets safe
Until the time we both find ourselves alone again, oh

When you're with me, no judgement (No judgement)
You can get that from everyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm (Yeah), when you're with me, no judgement
Mmm (Oh), we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement That first night, we were standin' at your door
Fumblin' for your keys, then I kissed you
Ask me if I wanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night
Then you took my hand and followed you

Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
I swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind
We're sixty-five and you asked
When did I first know, I always knew

And I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
I swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

And I want the world to witness when we finally say ""I do""
It's the way you love, I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons
But at night, when I close my eyes

I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you
And I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
I swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there

Buscabas tus llaves, luego te besé
Me preguntaste si queria entrar
Porque no queríamos que la noche terminara
Entonces tomaste mi mano y te seguí

Sí, nos veo de blanco y negro
Claro como el cristal en una noche estrellada
En todos tus hermosos colores
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida
Te veo de pie con tu vestido
Jurando delante de todos nuestros amigos
Nunca habrá otro
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida

Ahora estamos sentados aquí en tu sala de estar
Contando historias mientras compartimos una bebida o dos
Y hay una imagen que he estado teniendo en mi mente
Tenemos 65 años y tú preguntas
¿Cuándo lo supe por primera vez?, siempre lo supe

Nos veo de blanco y negro
Claro como el cristal en una noche estrellada
En todos tus hermosos colores
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida
Te veo de pie con tu vestido
Jurando delante de todos nuestros amigos
Nunca habrá otro
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida

Y quiero que el mundo sea testigo cuando finalmente digamos ""Acepto""
Es la forma en que amas, tengo que devolvértelo
No puedo prometer vallas o tardes soleadas
Pero de noche, cuando cierre mis ojos

Nos veo en blanco y negro
Claro como el cristal en una noche estrellada
Nunca habrá otra
Prometo que te amaré
Nos veo en blanco y negro
Claro como el cristal en una noche estrellada
En todos tus hermosos colores
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida
Te veo de pie con tu vestido
Jurando delante de todos nuestros amigos
Que nunca habrá otro (Nunca habrá)
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida

Y nunca habrá otra
Prometo que te amaré por el resto de mi vida

Mi ha detto dritto in faccia
Perché ti voglio da impazzire
Sì ti voglio, baby
Ci ho pensato tutto il giorno
E spero che tu ti senta come me
Perché ti voglio da impazzire
Sì ti voglio, baby
Lente, mani lente
Come sudore che gocciola sui nostri panni sporchi
No, nessuna possibilità
Che io me ne possa andare senza di te
So già che non ci potremo fermare
Le tue intenzioni e quelle
Mani lente
Mani lente
Voglio solo prendermi del tempo
Possiamo fare questo baby
Tutta la notte
Yeah
Perché ti voglio da impazzire
Sì ti voglio, baby
Lente, mani lente
Come sudore che gocciola sui nostri panni sporchi
No, nessuna possibilità
Che io me ne possa andare senza di te
So già che non ci potremo fermare
Le tue intenzioni e quelle
Mani lente
Le punte delle tue dita stanno facendo uno spettacolo
Mi hai preso ora e non posso dire di no
Voglio stare da solo con te
Portami a casa, portami a casa
Le punte delle tue dita stanno facendo uno spettacolo
Non avresti mai detto che ti desidero, baby
Mani lente
Come sudore che gocciola sui nostri panni sporchi
No, nessuna possibilità
Che io me ne possa andare senza di te
So già che non ci potremo fermare
Mani lente
Come sudore che gocciola sui nostri panni sporchi
No, nessuna possibilità
Che io me ne possa andare senza di te
So già che non ci potremo fermare
Le tue intenzioni e quelle
Mani lente
Mani lente
Mani lente I LOVE HIM Entras en la habitación, me quedo en silencio
Veo tus ojos y no muevo ni un parpado
Se siente como si el mundo nos encerrara en una islas
Una isla sin olas

Trato y trato de olvidarte
Pero tu mamá piensa que soy lo mejor para ti
Trato y trato de olvidarte
Pero no desaparecerás

Parece que cada vez que doblo una esquina, estas parada justo allí
Por encima de mi hombro, estás en todos lados
Juro que es difícil pensar, es difícil respirar cuando estás en el aire
Intento correr, pero estás en todas partes donde voy
Cuando pienso que estoy solo
Y mi corazón está bajo control
¿Por qué amarte no es justo?
Estás en todos lados

El suelo debajo de mis pies esta un poco más frio
Veo tu rostro en personas que no conozco
Se siente como si el mundo estuviera girando en cámara lenta
Estoy atrapado en un solo lugar

Trato y trato de olvidarte
Pero tu mamá piensa que soy lo mejor para ti
Trato y trato de olvidarte
Pero no desaparecerás

Parece que cada vez que doblo una esquina, estas parada justo allí
Por encima de mi hombro, estás en todos lados
Juro que es difícil pensar, es difícil respirar cuando estás en el aire
Intento correr, pero estás en todas partes donde voy
Cuando pienso que estoy solo
Y mi corazón está bajo control
¿Por qué amarte no es justo?
Estás en todos lados

En todos lados
A donde quiera que vaya
Pero aún no estás aquí
Y aún no estás aquí

Parece que cada vez que doblo una esquina, estas parada justo allí
Por encima de mi hombro, estás en todos lados
Juro que es difícil pensar, es difícil respirar cuando estás en el aire
Intento correr, pero estás en todas partes donde voy (Yeah)
Cuando pienso que estoy solo (Completamente solo)
Y mi corazón está bajo control (Oh no)
¿Por qué amarte no es justo?
Estás en todos lados
Estás en todos lados We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
Because I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
And I've been thinkin' 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands
Your slow hands

I just wanna take my time
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah
And 'cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands

Fingertips puttin' on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

Slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those slow hands (Woo!) I keep staring at the little white number
You left here in the summer
Hanging in my wardrobe
Do you still want it?
Do you still want it?
I know that I did you the service
Of calling 'cause I'm nervous
I know that we don't talk
I know that it's on purpose
Do you still want it?
But I'm holding on
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Or leave it out
Maybe it's time that I give you space
I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even if I don't want to, babe
I keep staring at that little white number
The one in the picture
When we lose our temper
You'd look at it for hours
But do you still want it?
You smile on the staircase and you open the door
Kissing on the couch
Make up in the drawer
Darling, do you still want it?
But I'm holding on
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Or leave it out
Maybe it's time that I give you space
I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even if I don't want to, babe
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
I know, you know, we both want it, babe
I know, you know, we both want it, babe
But I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even though I don't wanna, babe"
