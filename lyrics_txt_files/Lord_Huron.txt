"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met (Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh)

Oooh, ooh-ooh ooh

Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin', why, I'm a-wanderin'
Not while we’re both still alive

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
Please don't say I'm going alone

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well, if you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee

I was a-ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' the life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place?
I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die, but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh I’m leaving this place behind, and I’m heading out on the road tonight
I’m off for the hinterlands, way up north where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride, I'm asking Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man but he ain't gonna delay my plans
I know she's gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love, I'm gonna live my life with her
You know, I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him 'cause I'm a fool for love
I come for to find Big Jim, well, here I am and I guess you’re him
I see how you got your name, you're tall as hell and broad as a train
They say you’re a hard worn man
The baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well, I'm not afraid to fight, let's step outside and I'll show you why
I'm hummin' like a revved up truck
Nevermind the odds, I'm gonna try my luck with her
Just tell me when you've had enough
I'm dangerous 'cause I'm a fool for love
You know, you don't hit half bad
Oh, but I'm gonna lay you to ground tonight
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you on to an early death
I lie in the drifting snow, bleeding out as it covers me, oh
If spring comes before I’m found, just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
I lost friends along my way, I knew I’d meet them eventually
No, I’m not afraid to die, I’m just mad I left Big Jim alive
I know I should have never looked back
But you ain’t gonna win a woman’s heart like that
I never should have called his bluff
I was born to lose 'cause I’m a fool for love
I stare into the endless sky
And the sorry tale of my life goes by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don’t know where I’m goin'
I stare into the endless sky
And the sorry tale of my life goes by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don’t know where I’m goin' My one and only love
I've been lonely long enough
Will I find you when the night is over?
Tell me where did you go?
I've been searching high and low
I have only 'til the night is over
In every window, I pass
Your reflection in the glass
Makes me wonder if my mind is going
Shadows shifting in the rain
Slowly driving me insane
By the stars above, I know we were in love
I have only ’til the night is over
I feel the weather change
I hear the river say your name
I watch the birds fly by
I see an emerald in the sky

Now the trail has gone cold
I don’t know where else to go
And my time, I fear, is nearly over
When the ocean drinks the sky
And the city winks its eye
When the night is done, you’ll vanish in the sun
Will I hold you when the night is over?
Am I lost inside my mind?
There’s an emerald in the sky
I hear the river say your name
By the stars above, I know we were in love
I hear the river say your name
I have only ’til the night is over Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, few have seen it, but everybody talks
Spirits follow everywhere I go
Oh, they sing all day and they haunt me in the night
Oh, they sing all day and they haunt me in the night

Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and what ain't living can never really die
You don't want me, baby, please don't lie
Oh, but if you're leaving, I gotta know why
I said if you're leaving, I gotta know why
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night

Yes I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and the moonlight, baby, shows you what's real
There ain't language for the things I feel
And if I can't have you, then no one ever will
Oh, if I can't have you, then no one ever will

I don't feel it till it hurts sometimes
Oh, go on baby, hurt me tonight
I want ours to be an endless song
Baby, in my eyes, you do no wrong
I don't feel it till it hurts sometimes
So go on, baby, hurt me tonight
All the spirits that I know I saw
Do you see no ghost in me at all?

Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you
Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river

I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees
If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life

Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again

And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher
If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river I took a little journey to the unknown
And I come back changed, I can feel it in my bones
I fucked with the forces that our eyes can't see
Now the darkness got a hold on me
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

How long, baby, have I been away?
Oh, it feels like ages, though you say it's only days
There ain't language for the things I've seen, yeah
And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
The truth is stranger than all my dreams
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me

I have seen what the darkness does
Say goodbye to who I was
I ain't never been away so long
Don't look back, them days are gone
Follow me into the endless night
I can bring your fears to light
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Meet me in the woods tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Yeah, the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me

I have seen what the darkness does
Say goodbye to who I was
I ain't never been away so long
Don't look back, them days are gone
Follow me into the endless night
I can bring your fears to light
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Meet me in the woods tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Well, the neon lights burned red and gold
I came to have my fortune told
Can't imagine what she saw
While gazing in her crystal ball

Far out past the astral plane
I cast you back from whence you came
Cosmic ash and blackened brain
I call you by your ancient names

I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her

What the fortune teller said is
I'm alive for now but good as dead
She claims she'd seen it all
While she was gazing in her crystal ball

If I can't evade my fate
Then I won't sit around and wait
A fallen star will be thy bane
I call you by your ancient names

I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see another sunrise)
I gotta get away from her
(Oh, if I leave this place alive)
I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see another sunrise)
Oh I gotta get away from her

I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her

I gotta get away from here
If I live to see the next sunrise
I gotta get away from her
Oh, if I leave this place alive What you're looking for won't be found easily
It grows upon the mountain in a sacred place
Up beyond the clouds, in ancient ground, so they say
And many men have died trekking up that way


Once he's gazed upon her, a man is forever changed
The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain
Ages come and go, but her life goes on the same
She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain

Her colors change to mark the passing of the days
No Earthly sight can match the beauty she displays
And when I die I want her lying by my side
In my grave, in my grave

I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur

I'm meant to find the place where all good things begin
To smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind
And when I die I want her lying by my side
In my grave, in my grave

I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur
I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur Lost in time and space
Aimless drifting into a far off place
Hurtling through the vast unknown
Staring straight into the pure, black void
Drowning in the sea of stars
Lost in a galaxy of cocktail bars
Blinded by the neon lights
I lie awake and say your name into the night

I guess she’s gone for good
She don’t call me like I thought she would
She went west to chase her dreams
She took my money, but she didn’t take me
Why go wander unknown worlds?
Stay right here and let the cosmos twirl
Blind without her source of light
I light a flame and say her name into the night

I don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am

Lost in time and space
Aimless searching for a long, lost face
Haven’t got a thing to lose
If I don’t find her, gonna tie that noose
I quit my job and packed my car
Left in a hurry, and I've sure come far
Driving fast with no headlights
I’m wide awake, I say her name into the night
Oh, I'll find a way, I say your name into the night

I don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am I had a name but they took it from me
I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place where I lay my head
They burnt it to the ground and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet talkin’ wife and a beautiful girl
I know I’m never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up until I have my revenge
They took my life but it isn’t the end
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead
I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm coming for them
They put me in the ground but I'm back from the dead
I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm coming for them
They put me in the ground but I'm back from the dead
You'll hear me howl in the light of the moon
That's how you'll know that I'm coming for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
When the World Ender comes better run for your life
I’ll never bleed and I won’t ever age
I’ll never feel the embrace of the grave
The fair and the brave and the good must die
I seen the other side of living, I know heaven's a lie
I’ll tear through the night, and I'll raise some hell
Cause I'm the World Ender, baby and I'm back from the dead
Lord knows I should be pushing daisies
I was 6 feet down, but something raised me up
Sent back for to lift my curse
I’m gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied, gonna get little wild
Go screaming through the dark like a demon child
Close your eyes now, the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m back from the grave
They can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead
I’m the World Ender, baby and I’m back from the dead
They can run for their lives but they cannot be 
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead
I’m the World Ender, baby and I’m back from the dead
They can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead Many nights have I heard her voice
Whisper my name without making a noise
Calling out from a pure, black void

Tears of sorrow or tears of joy
Drops in my cup as my mind is destroyed
Staring into a pure, black void

So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?

Many evils have I enjoyed
Prowling the night raising hell with the boys
Getting high on a pure, black void

I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void

So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?

Where can you go when it’s all in your head?
These are the last words that I ever said
Where can you go when it’s all in your head?

I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void
I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void Gone are the days of laughter and love
Gone, baby, gone, we've all had enough
Carry on and spend all your dough
Take it down to the ground and sink me below

I scream and shout like this
Just to prove to the world that I still exist
I don't believe in life
And I won't believe in death 'til I die

Gone are the days of laughter and love
Gone, baby, gone, we've all had enough
Carry on to spend all your dough
Take it down to the ground and sink me below

I live my life like this
Just to prove to the world that I still exist
I don't believe in life
And I won't believe in death 'til I die Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh

I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains, I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh

Where could that girl have gone?
Where? I've wandered far
Where could that girl have gone?
She left no trail, but I cannot fail; I will find her

(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

Where could that girl have gone?
Where? I've wandered far
Where could that girl have gone?
She left no trace, but I know her face; I will find her

Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh

When last I saw her, she was dancing all alone
Perhaps my chance was then; I'll never know
I'll search the world until there's no place left to go
And if she leaves it, I will follow, I will follow


(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains, I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought Here by the lake, what a vision you are
In the light of the emerald star
I’ve come for you, my love
Through a window in the dark
Don’t you know you’re my everything?
If I lost you, I think I would die
Was everything you said just a lie?

You never loved me
I came all the way through time and space
To take you away and out of this place
With the moonlight in your eyes
You’re the brightest star in all of the sky
I’ll cry and I’ll cry if your light ever dies

Oh, what a jewel are you
And, oh, what a fool am I
For squandering my love
On an emerald in the sky
Way out here in the void
Is the loneliest place to die
When everything you loved is a lie

You never loved me
I came all the way through time and space
To take you away and out of this place
You’re an emerald in the sky
You light up the night by blinkin’ your eyes
I’ll cry and I’ll cry if your light ever dies I will wake her in the morning
Once the dew has dried
I will say it to her face
“You’re a conjured lie; a figment of my mind
Baby, I don’t mind
Are you dead or are you alive?”

She was gone without a warning
Long before the sunrise
I will paint the perfect face
I will draw her eyes with the pigment of my mind
I will trace her lines
‘Cause I have traced them thousands of times

All my days are filled with mourning
All my nights are empty
I just stare out into space
Searching for her eyes in a never-ending sky
Leave me where I lie
I don’t care if I live or die

I will never ever love another one the way I loved her
If I ever learn to love again
I will wait until the end
‘Cause I don’t know where, I don’t know when
Maybe, I'm gon' see her again

I will never ever love another one the way I loved her
If I ever learn to love again
I will wait until the end
‘Cause I don’t know where, I don’t know when
Maybe, I'm gon' see her again

I will wake her in the morning
I will wake her in the morning I'm just a man, but I know that I'm damned
All the dead seem to know where I am
The tale that began on the night of my birth
Will be done in a turn of the earth

Lie where I land, let my bones turn to sand
I was born on the lake and I don't want to leave it
Every eye on the coast ever more
Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore

Under the waves and the earth of an age
Lie a thousand old northerners' graves
Deep in the night when the moon's glowing bright
They come rising up into the night

Die if I must, let my bones turn to dust
I'm the lord of the lake and I don't want to leave it
All who sail off the coast ever more
Will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore

I'm goin' away for a long time
I'm goin' away for a long time

Lie where I land, let my bones turn to sand
I was born on the lake and I don't want to leave it
Every eye on the coast ever more
Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore

Die if I must, let my bones turn to dust
I'm the lord of the lake and I don't want to leave it
All who sail off the coast ever more
Will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore

I'm goin' away for a long time... I land on an island coast
Where the only souls I see are ghosts
I run through a wooded isle
And I chase the sunlight, mile after mile
And I feel like I know this place
As the tree line breaks into wide-open space
I stare at a bright red sun
Though I search all day, I never find anyone

I walk on a winding road
In the deep of the night, near the edge of the known
I pass by a moonlit lake
And a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake
And I feel I should know this place
As the road winds on into wide-open space
The wind plays a haunting tone
As I make my way through the night all alone

I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
And a road that don't never end
I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
What am I destined to be? It's a mystery, baby
Just please don't leave me alone, yeah

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I lie under starlit sky
And the seasons change in the blink of an eye
I watch as the planets turn
And the old stars die and the young stars burn
But I don't really know this place
And it's lonesome here in the wide-open space
Can it be as real as it seems?
Maybe this time, I won't wake from the dream

I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
And a road that don't never end
I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
What am I destined to be? It's a mystery, baby
Just please don't leave me alone, yeah


Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh I sit alone in the dark, and I try to remember
The words you spoke when you summoned the Ender
You chained my life to an ancient master
Will the curse be reversed if I say it backwards?

What you crossed was a line at the edge of the void
And you can’t crawl back without making a choice
But then something escaped when you opened the gate
You cheated death and sealed your fate

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
1, 2, 3, 4

Put on your new dress tonight
Have a look to the west, the moon’s in the sky
I wanna get at least that high
Wanna leave the Earth and my things behind
You told me you’re never gonna die
How am I supposed to sleep through the night?
You showed me the secret of life
I can’t forget that look in your eye

Been a long time gone, living out on the coast
It’s a long way back from the edge of the cosmos
Truths once known never come unknown
I learned that lesson lives ago
To die for good, it must be earned
The ways of death can never be learned
And the life I’ve lived is only dust
The darkness comes for all of us

Put on your new dress tonight
Have a look to the west, the moon’s in the sky
I wanna get at least that high
Wanna leave the Earth and all things behind
You told me you’re never gonna die
How am I supposed to sleep through the night?
You showed me the secret of life
I can’t forget that look in your eye

La, da, da
La, da ,da Good for nothing is the name they'll remember me by
Done nothin' with my life for no one, I'm just waitin' to die
I turned my back on the world
You know I'd given up on livin' til I met you girl
Then you came into my life with come hither in your eyes
Pulling me outta the grave what a nice surprise
I die when our nights end, but I only stay dead til I see you again

I lie awake in the night just to see another dawn
Used to be the sun was my weakness but them days are gone
I feel your lips on mine
Will you meet me by the river, baby, one more time?
I'll give you what you wanna have
I'll take you where you wanna go
I'm the only man you'll ever need, girl, and now you know
I'll write your name on my skin, as a promise that we'll never be apart again

I feel alive when I'm with you, baby
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
Don't wanna die I wanna wander the world with you
And no one else for the rest of my days on this earth

I turned my back on the world
I wasn't always like this, girl
Do you know what loneliness does to a man?
Turn him into the walking dead
I may have died but your lovin' raised me

I feel alive when I'm with you, baby
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
You saved my life I just wanna repay you in kind
Ain't no one else ever tell you you're beautiful, girl?
I feel alive when I'm with you, baby
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
Don't wanna die I wanna wander the world with you
And no one else for the rest of my days on this earth I know the rain like the clouds know the sky
I speak to birds and tell them where to fly
I sing the songs that you hear on the breeze
I write the names of the rocks and the trees

Oh, you fool, there are rules I am coming for you
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins

I tried to warn you when you were a child
I told you not to get lost in the wild
I sent you omens and all kinds of signs
I taught you melodies, poems, and rhymes

Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
(You can run but you can't escape)
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
(You will open the yawning grave)

Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
(You can run but you can't escape)
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
(You will open the yawning grave) Heaven never ever heard a word I said
I’ve cried enough to raise the dead
“Everything comes and goes,” they say
Here tomorrow, gone today
Heaven won’t let me in, I don’t know why
No one ever loved half as much as I
Everyone’s a sinner in the balancer’s eye
I’ve prayed enough, I rolled the dice
Anyone’s luck can turn, I’ve heard
Not soon enough, I gave my word
I was born right into nothing
Under a very bad sign
Can I cross beyond that line?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Nothing’s waiting for us in the great sky
Life is equal to dust in the balancer’s eye
Now I know that I can’t lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Will I ever be forgiven for the crime of my life?
Will it haunt me ’til I die?
To the end of time
To the end of time
To the end of time
To the end of time
Heaven won’t let me in, I don’t know why
No one ever loved half as much as I
If I follow the starlight and call your name
Will I see you again on the astral plane?
Why did learnin' the truth make me feel worse?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Doesn’t matter; it’s too late to do right
Heading into the void at the speed of light
Now I know that I can’t lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Follow the emerald star! It's time to run; they'll string me up for all that I've done
I'm going soon; gonna leave tonight by the light of the moon
I did it all for you; well, I hope you know the lengths I've gone to
What's a man to say? They'll be looking for me, should be on my way

(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everyone to know that you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) But I ain't ever gonna let 'em take my life from me

I've no regrets; I will not ask for your forgiveness
Lower your defense; run away with me and it'll all make sense
I did it all for you; don't spurn me after all I've gone through
No time to rest; I'm gonna find me a life, baby, way out west

(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everyone to know that you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) But I ain't ever...


I will run, but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds
I will run, but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds

It's time to run; well, I hope you understand what I've done
Run away for you; I'm gonna count the days 'til you make it through
I did it all for you; well, I hope you live the life you want to
My time is spent; baby, please don't tell 'em just where I went

(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everyone to know that you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) But I ain't ever gonna let 'em take my life from me

(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everyone to know that you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh) But I ain't ever... I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah, the sky was falling and time was bending
I watched the heavens collide right before my eyes

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

I had a visitor come from the great beyond
And telling me our time that the world is done
And to watch for a sign in the midnight sky

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day


We wait for the sunrise
We watch as the world dies
We howl in the moonlight
When the World Ender comes, baby, don't close your eyes
We wait for the sunrise
We wait for the sunrise

I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah the sky was falling and time was bending
We spent our last night in the moonlight
Baby, it's so bright— we'll be up all night

I got a helluva view for the end of the world
I've got a bottle of booze and a beautiful girl
If I'm a-goin' to die, I'm gonna go in style

Yeah, what if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

Yeah, we going till the night turns into the day
Yeah, we going till the night turns into the day
Yeah, we going till the night turns into the day
Yeah, we keep it going till the night turns into the day Deep into the night
With the moonlight as my guide
I will wander through the pines and make my way to nature's shrines
And I look up to the sky
And I know you're still alive
But I wonder where you are, I call your name into the dark

I wake up in the morning, oh, and I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside and huddled in the wind

And it feels like I've been away for an era, but nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you but, oh, what did you you do and where have you gone?

On the night you disappeared
Oh, if I had seen you clear
But the strange light in the sky was shining right into my eyes
There was no one else in sight
Just the endless frozen pines
But I wonder how they know, cause they don't die if they don't grow

I am ready to follow you even though I don't know where
I've been waiting the night until you decide to take me there

Cause I know I don't wanna stay here forever it's gotta be moving on
Oh, I don't wanna be the only one living if all of my friends are gone

I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through, there's another light beyond the lie
I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through, there's another life beyond the lie I get a thrill outta playing with fire
'Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick outta thunder and lightning, and
Tearing through the night hollering your name

I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I drive fast and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight

I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreaming and you wake up dead
It's a long night; can I spend it with you?
'Cause you're oh-so-pretty when you stand on the edge

Oh little darlin', don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined— what does it matter?
Oh, come inside; can I get you to stay?

Oh little darlin', don't you like falling down
Through the sky like a diving plane
Real or imagined— what does it matter?
Now, come inside; can I get you to stay?

What is life?
Only visions
When I die
I'm coming right on back for you
Who am I?
An illusion
Would I lie?
I'm coming right on back for you

Oh little darlin', don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined— what does it matter?
Oh, come inside; can I get you to stay?

Oh little darlin', don't you get lonely?
Look in my eyes, gimme one more day
Real or imagined— what does it matter?
Now, come inside; can I get you to stay? I had a dream that you came to me shining down
Through the clouds like a moonbeam
There you were
And you wore nothing more than your raven hair
In the air like a moonbeam
Here you were

And you pulled me from a nightmare
With your eyes and your silver touch
Shone a little bit of light there
Now the darkness don’t scare me much
La da da da
La da da da

You can feign your surprise, give me those doe eyes
But I know I wanna love you
Yes I do
We can dance to the beat while I tap my feet
On the stars, you’re gonna like me
Yes you are

When you saved me from a bad dream
I was drifting through time and space
But I landed on a moonbeam
Take me out of this place

The world is dark the night is long
I could use a few laughs and a couple of songs
The sun will rise above the hills
You’ll be leaving me soon, like hell you will
The awe when gazing at the moon
Is the feeling that I get when I’m lookin’ at you
The sun will rise and fade the star
And you’re leaving me soon, like hell you are
And you’re leaving me soon, like hell you are
La da da da
La da da da

I had a dream that you came to me shining down
Through the clouds like a moonbeam
There you were
I had a dream that you came to me shining down
Through the clouds like a moonbeam
There you were You've been gone for a long, long time
You've been in the wind, you've been on my mind
You are the purest soul I've ever known
In my life
Take your time, let the rivers guide you in
You know where you can find me again
I'll be waiting here till the stars fall out
Of the sky

When you left, I was far too young
To know you're worth more than the moon and the sun
You are still alive when I look to the sky
In the night
I would wait for a thousand years
I would sit right here by the lake, my dear
You just let me know that you're coming home
And I'll wait for you

Years have gone, but the pain is the same
I have passed my days by the sound of your name
Well, they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby, oh-ho?
Death is a wall, but it can't be the end
You are my protector and my best friend
Well, they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby, oh-ho?

How do they know? Well, they don't... I can't trust anyone or anything these days
If you are who you say you are, then show your face
Came out of the ocean like you came out of a dream
Your voice, it sounds familiar but you are not what you seem
All words of comfort can not take away my doubt
I've decided if it kills me I'll find out what you're about
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers you're the strangest that I've seen
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
If you are who you say you are, then show me your face
Know enough to say you are not what you claim to be
I've kept close watch upon you and I don't like what I see
Can't escape the feeling that you'll get me in the night
I'll sleep with one eye open, and I'm not afraid to fight
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers you're the strangest that I've seen
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
Know what you want and why
Of all the strangers your the strangest that I've seen
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone no anything these days
You are not the one you say you are 
Now that I've seen your face I'm haunted by the letters of your name  Yellow lines in the dead of the night
Oh, I was heading back out west
Trying to keep my eyes open wide
I'd gone days without any rest
Saw him lying in the road looking bad
About 20 yards ahead
You come back from a trip to the East
But you don't come back from the dead

Sure as hell, he was dead as they come
And he was already starting to smell
Just a kid with his hair slicked back
And a knife tucked into his belt
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life
That never felt like his?
Though I was was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
And lay his soul to rest out in the desert night

I laid him down in a grave in the sand
And he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand
He said: ""I know I'm dead, but I don't wanna lie
In a grave out here where the coyotes cry
I stared right into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
And there ain't no thrills in the afterlife

So lift me up out of here, my friend
And I'll wander the night till the ages end""
Lit by the moon, he walked through the sand
And he waved goodbye with his dead man's hand


And he will roam forever, haunting the desert
And he will roam forever, haunting the desert I'm a long way from the land that I left
I've been running through life and cruising toward death
If you think that I'm scared you've got me wrong
If you don't know my name, you'll know it now
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

I'm a long way from the one that I loved
I've been tending old flames, lamenting what was
Drifting in a land that time forgot
If you think that I've changed, you know me not
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
I been unraveling since my birth
Gonna wander out there and see what I'm worth

Follow me  way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you to who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
It would only make me late, for a date I can't escape

Follow me way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you to who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
It would only make me late, for a date I can't escape What I remember the most
Is hollering her name
And the sirens wail as we ran like hell down a strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did
I wanna know her game
I wanna learn her wits and how she plays her tricks, oh, I gotta know

Lots of booze and her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix
I was under her spell
And today I feel like hell
She got me going, I guess
Who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through

'Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
I don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
I don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me

I gotta find me a cure
I gotta clear my name
There's gotta be some way
I hope it's not too late
To break the spell
Yeah
I want to get her alone
I want to ask her why
And look into those eyes
And see the endless night
Staring back

What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name
And she'll make me do worse
If the law doesn't get me first
She has turned my heart black
And there ain't no turning back

There are runes on my skin
They appear when she walks in
I am bound by her spell
I am chained to do her will
I'm a goner, I guess
Who knew love was gonna be like this?
She has cloaked me in black
And there ain't no turning back

I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
I don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
I don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me
That girl has laid a curse on me I wanna live in a land of lakes
Where the great waves break and the night runs right into the day
Wanna be with ones I left
But I’m way out west, and the years keep on slipping away
Wanna run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins, where the fires of my ancestors burned
I remember that fateful day
When I ran away and you told me I couldn’t return

You made me swear I’d never forget
I made a vow I’d see you again
I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake


I've been running a long, long time
Trying to flee that life, but I can’t seem to leave it behind
Wanna visit the windswept shores
Of a time before, when the moon and the stars were aligned
I remember the bright spring day
When you sparked that flame, and a fire that continues to burn
I remember the day I left
Headin’ way out west, when you told me to never return

You made me swear I’d never forget
I made a vow I’d see you again
I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake

I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake I came back from the edge — where you go when you die
I fell back down to Earth through a hole in the sky
I crashed into the sea, then somehow I survived
Don’t know what to believe, but I know I’m alive
Back from the edge
I was nearly destroyed when I looked in her eyes
I got lost in the void as I pondered the size
I got black-brained to death, but I just wouldn’t die
I came back from the edge, I came back from the edge
Back from the edge
Back from the edge
Back from the edge
I came back from the edge
I came back from the edge Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

They said we're all gonna die, but I'll never believe it
I love this world and I don't wanna leave it
Said that death is a deal that you cannot refuse
But I love you, girl, and I don't wanna lose you

Don't want a long ride
I don't wanna die at all
I wanna be the man who lives forever
I ain't never gonna die and I want you to come

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

They said life is a tale, it begins and it ends
And forever's a word that we can't understand
Well, I know that my life's better when we're together
So why can't our story just go on forever?

Don't want a long ride
I don't wanna die at all
I wanna be the man who lives forever
I ain't never gonna die and I want you to come

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

They said life without end wouldn't have any meaning
The journey to death is the point of our being
Well, the point of my life is to be with you, babe
But there ain't enough time in the life that they gave me

They said we're all gonna die, but I'll never believe it
I love this world and I don't wanna leave it
Said that death is a deal that you cannot refuse
But I love you, girl, and I don't wanna lose you

(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever
(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever
(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever
(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever

And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive) You arrive along with the sun
Where have you been, darlin'? What have you done?
You were out finding trouble again
There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands
Come inside and lie down to sleep
You ain't gonna run and you know that you're beat
Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do

Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever

Lord knows you've been 'round in your day
But this kind of trouble, won't just go away
Darlin', now you're adrift in the deep
So just lay down your head and I'll sing you to sleep


Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh She was wise beyond all others
On the island she was my lover
We went wild and it almost killed me, I was blind
But for thirteen days of sun and her I thought I'd never die
I couldn't get tired, though I should have been sleeping
For the first time I wasn't hard of feeling
And at night, while the others were dreaming, we went wild
We'd go running through the temples and the forests of the isle
For thirteen of those sleepless nights I thought I'd never die
I don't know what the hell it was that gave me so much life
On the island we went wild, we never closed our eyes
Don't know where she's gone or what she's done to who since then
She loved me right into the ground, I won't go wild again
I thought good times could last forever
Long nights and perfect weather
I tried to never say never, but I was wrong
The wildness of those days, well they couldn't last for long
I woke up on the beach one day and found that she had gone
The rains had come, there was no sun, I felt so deadly tired
After thirteen days of loving her I felt like I could die
We went wild (x9) Through the dawning age
We go walking together
Toward the yawning grave
Burning days as we make our way
We'll leave our bones in the dust
An untold legend is lighting up
What if I was the last sight you ever saw
Would you die with a smile on your face
Well don't even try to say you will
'Cause you'd hardly recognize the sight
The young are getting old and the summer is cold
All the birds have been singing at night
When we're dead and gone
Will the mountains remember
Or just carry on
Moving as slow as the forest grows
And turn our bones into dust
An untold legend is lighting up
When will I reach that light that I'm running to
When I die
Will it turn out forever
There's a fire burning inside of me
When I die
Will I burn out forever
You don't need to lie, I know it will
'Cause the darkness doesn't need the light
All the young are getting old and the summer is cold
And all the birds have been singing at night
Well, don't even try to save me, friend
'Cause I know it ain't worth the fight
All the young are getting old and the summer is cold
And all the birds have been singing at night ~chanting~

How long have I known you, brother?
Hundreds of lives, thousands of years
How many miles have we wandered
Under the sky, chasing our fear?
Some kind of trouble is coming
Don't know when, don't know what
I will stand by you, brother
Till the daylight comes or I'm dead and gone

I've shared my life with you, brother
Since I recall, you've been my friend
You say we're not like the others
Still, we must die; all things must end
I know we can't stop what's coming
But I will try, oh, how I'll try
Will you fight with me, brother?
One last time, one last fight?

Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end

~chanting~

~chanting~

Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end I've been waiting for you to come
Staring out at the setting sun
You've been running 'round again
With that boy you call your friend
And it's driving me insane
Does he make you say his name?
And you can't get it off your tongue
Little girl, you are not so young
Does it hurt when you lie to me
If you'd asked, I would set you free
But the time to forgive is gone
The day has passed, the night has come
Ain't you worried what I'll do?
And that boy should worry, too
Can you face me for what you've done?
Little girl, you're not so young
Oh, is he ready to die for you, baby?
Naw, but you know I was
I'm fond of living
But I would have given it all for the girl I love
Oh, is he ready to die for you, baby?
Now that the deed is done
I'm just waiting for night
And the fading light of the setting sun
Tell me when did I lose your love?
Was it him you were thinking of
All those nights when you made me swoon
Making love beneath the moon?
Were you dreaming of his touch?
When you couldn't get enough
Was there truth in the songs you sung?
Little girl, you're not so young
Well, I could never betray your love
You had me, heart and soul
You might never have known it, girl
But I was all yours
I know I'll never reclaim your love
But that's just how it goes
I ain't the person I was this morning when the sun rose
Well, I could never betray your love
You had me, heart and soul
You might never have known it, girl
But I was all yours
I know I'll never reclaim your love
But that's just how it goes
I ain't the person I was this morning when the sun rose
I know I'll never replace your love and that's as hard as it gets
So I'll be taking a life this evening when the sun sets Oh there was a time when she'd lie in the grass
And imagine the places she'd never go
And there all alone she would pleasure herself
With the thoughts of a man she would never know
Lying there, she made a promise that one day she'd run
And she'd find just the man she was looking for
Well, she fell in love with that son of a gun
But he was not the man that she took him for
When he came to town he came rambling in
On a great cloud of dust carried by the wind
Oh, it wasn't long before he pulled her in
And he asked her to come run away with him
He saw a pretty young girl who was ready to run
And she saw just the chance she'd been looking for
Well, she fell in love with that son of gun
But he was not the man that she took him for
They headed out west driving into the sun
And he promised her she was the only one
Well, he was a thief and he'd steal just for fun
He'd go cruising around with his little gun
He ran afoul of the law and decided to run
And he left her alone with their little one
Well, she was in love with that son of a gun
And the story between them it wasn't done
When she finds him she will make him regret he was ever born You were a wild thing when you were younger
Stomping through the jungle
You were mighty and you were stronger
But I bow no longer
All your temples will lie in ruin
Once I ravage through them
All your rivals will not go near you
But I do not fear you
Well, you howl and you roar
But I am not afraid of you anymore. (x4)
You think you can have it?
Then come and get it Last night you were a dream
Now you're just you
And I am just a fool
Someone you once knew
But last night you were a dream
Now you're just you
And I am just a fool
Someone you once knew
Before the night was over
After love was through
Last night you were a dream
Now you're just you
Well, last night you were a dream
Now you're just you
And I am just a fool
Someone you once knew
Before the night was over
After love was through
Last night you were a dream
Now you're just you
In midst of innocence
Experience arrives
Like a guest you can't impress
The future in disguise
Questioning the things you know
But asking for too much
Dressing all your hopes in woe
Kicking out the crutch
Last night you were a dream
Now you're just you
And I am just a fool
Someone you once knew If you got what you came for, why should you stay?
If you know where you're going, why delay?
If you won't be returning, don't say goodbye.
Turn your back on the ocean, follow the sun through the sky.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I've already forgotten all of your names.
And I cannot remember when you came.
Grab your things and get going, don't say goodbye.
Turn your back on the ocean, go see what's out there to find.
It's time to let go,
Goodbye and so long.
All the best along the way,
Couldn't I keep you another day?(x2)
When will I see you again?
When?
When Will I see you again?
When?
When will I see you again.
When?
When will I see you again?
When?
When will I see you again?(x2) Tell my family
I had to leave
I'm going away
Tell my friends for me
They'd all agree
That I gotta get out of here

Gonna sail that boat right into the sun
'Cause everybody knows that's how it's done
Now don't you cry then don't you wait
If I meet my end, well that'd be my fate

Gonna sail that boat right into the sun
'Cause everybody knows that's how it's done
Now don't you cry then don't you wait
If I meet my end, well that'd be my fate

Give my things away
Forget my name
I'm leaving today
If you see me again
It'll be my skeleton
'Cause I won't be back alive

You are as soft as a feather
You are as gorgeous as ever
You are exactly what I should want
But I don't want you
No I don't want you
So I'm going
Away

Yeah...

Now don't you cry then don't you wait
If I meet my end, well that'd be my fate I have come to speak with you about your daughter
She's no girl, she's a woman sir
If she wants to go and see the world she oughta
You have kept her here for twenty years alone
But I'll have you know she's fully grown
And she sure knows just what she wants, my god
If you won't allow her leaving I must take her
I'm seeing red and I'd kill you dead
If you tried to keep her here, no you can't make her
You imagine that she's just as pure as ever
But I have been known to shake her bones
Yeah we've been known to shudder and moan together
I am not the problem. You are
I love her. She loves me. I thought you should know"
