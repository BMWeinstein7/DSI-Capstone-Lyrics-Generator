"Been travelling these wide roads
For so long
My heart's been far from you
Ten thousand miles gone

Oh, I wanna come near and give
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

In my darkness I remember
Momma's words reoccur to me
""Surrender to the good Lord
And he'll wipe your slate clean""

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Oh, go, take me to your river
I wanna know

Dip me in your smooth water
As I go in
As a man with many crimes, come up for air
As my sins flow down the Jordan

Oh, I wanna come near and give you
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

Take me to your river
I wanna go
Oh, go, take me to your river
I wanna know

I wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go (Hoo)
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go (Oh, yeah)
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know (Hoo)

Hoo, oh, take me to your river
I wanna go
Lord, oh, please let me know
Take me to your river
I wanna know Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender sweet loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste
In my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want
I wanna be around
I wanna be around girl
I wanna be around girl
You, I wanna be around
Baby, how I'd be grieving
If you wanted to leave me all alone now
By myself, I don't want nobody else
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want
I wanna be around
I wanna be around girl
I wanna be around girl
You, I wanna be around
Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender loving

Sugar
I need you baby
Girl I, I need your loving
Darling, wanna hold you close
Girl, girl Don't wanna get ahead of myself
Feeling things I've never felt
It's kinda hard for me to explain
Her personality and everything
Brings me to my knees, ooh
She shines me up like gold on my arm
I wanna take it slow but it's so hard
I love to see her face in daylight
It's more than just our bodies at night
But she's really tempting me, ooh
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?

I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

I wanna bring her 'round to meet ya
I think you'd like her kind demeanor
I know that Grandma would've loved her, like she was her own
She makes me feel at home, ooh
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?

I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

I give up, I'm in love crying out to you
O me o my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
O me o my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
O me o my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?

I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

She might just be mine, be mine I don't want much
I just wanna be a better man
To my baby
Meet me off good luck
I was singing with them Jezebels
Under perfume sheets
Got a golden smile, heart overflow
But got us in love, but it wasn't enough

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

All night long I was out
Out 'till the morning
But baby you're tender
Lost when I'm longing
Baby please, I'm down on my knees begging
I thirst for you girl
Baby I'm running to your well

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

Am I the stupid one for doing everything that I did for us?

I put a pillow under your hair
Gave you tender loving my care
And I didn't make it a thing, ya mama didn't know that I was there
I tried to swallow my pride
When you left me lonely outside
And I didn't know you would never show, you're so comfortable with white lies
Looking like a fool what else could I do after all we’ve been through it still hurts

But I forgive you though my friends tell me not to
I forgive you even when it's so hard to

When we are good we're great
But I couldn’t keep on carrying on this way
Won't ever be the same
But I'd rather know you're better off than when you left us

Gave you tender loving my care
And I didn't make it a thing, ya mama didn't know that I was there

Looking like a fool what else could I do after all we’ve been through it still hurts

Hearts and records spinning, round (Mmm)

Crawling from a feeling now

Daisy Mae 504 black girl carried me
In her womb to the land of the peach
Her birthing pains brought me low
But she held me high on Peachtree road
Got my mother’s eyes and my father’s nose
Also got brother's hand-me-down clothes
We had no green but the love was strong
It was all we’d need to get us along, get us along

Left ATL for the Texas way
We drove 20 East in my daddy's '88
I learned in school I didn't measure up
I fell short of what true blackness was
Mama taught the righteous way
I set down that path but went astray
Paid for love on a crescent moon
In that Oklahoma motel room
Kyree taught me chords to strum
They got me through when I felt numb

504 black girl
504 black girl carried me
504 black girl, black girl
504 black girl carried me
504 black girl carried me
504 black girl carried me You don't know
The things that you do to me
Time moves slower
When I'm in your galaxy

Stop thinkin' it over, you might change your mind
Pull you little closer, one step at a time
Hangin' on your words, I don't care if they're lies

You don't know that you got me feeling like
Ooh baby, ah baby, ooh baby, ah baby
Ooh, ya got me feeling like
Ooh baby, ah baby, ooh baby, ah baby
Ooh, ya got me feeling like

You don't know
But it's right in front of me
You ain't got to play it cool, baby
Find that fire, set it free

Stop thinkin' it over, you might change your mind
Pull you little closer, one step at a time
Hangin' on your words, I don't care if they're lies

You don't know that you got me feeling like
Ooh baby, ah baby, ooh baby, ah baby
Ooh, ya got me feeling like
Ooh baby, ah baby, ooh baby, ah baby
Ooh, ya got me feeling like

Any time, any place, anywhere, you wake up
Any time, any place, anywhere, you wake up
Any time, any place, anywhere, you wake up
Any time, any place, anywhere, you wake up

I wanna (pull away) from you
It's been too long
I wanna (walk away) right now
I thought that our love was true
But all along, I was wrong

My pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
Our love, I thought I could sustain
Don't worry about me anymore
Cause I'll be gone by the morning time

Whoa, girl
I (poured out my heart) to you
Despite
You put a (knife in my back), straight through
I thought that our love was true
But all along, I was wrong

My pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
Our love, I thought I could sustain
Don't worry about me anymore
Cause I'll be gone by the morning time

I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong Flowers of the fields
Here today, vanish in the wind
Go to sleep, you may not wake up with the morning sunrise
Move so fast, baby, right before you close your eyes

So you better run
Move fast like the bullet from the gun
Over the hills, salvation rests in the sun
Eternity, baby, rests in the sun
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?

Making plans (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
For tomorrow (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Even though you don't (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Don't know your fate (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Blind eyes (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Leaning on a whole dead faith (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
Sink your feet into (ooh, bop, bop, bop)
A concrete foundation (ooh, bop, bop, bop)

So you better run
Move fast like the bullet from the gun
Over the hills, salvation rests in the sun
Eternity, baby, rests in the sun
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?

Eternity, baby, rest in the sun
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby?
So won't you come?
So won't you come, baby? I got a call from my baby, said she fed up with me
Said she's found another lover in another city
Said she's doing fine in New Orleans

Now she got me pacing, huh, wondering where'd I go wrong
Got me going in circles like the merry-go-round
Gonna take the west train to Louisiana in the morning

Sweet little girl from the ninth ward of New Orleans
The way she dancing, you could see her from Tennessee
Up under that red dress are legs long as the bayou trees
She got a golden smile, I know she's the one for me in the room

She's a-twistin' and a-groovin', shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me, I
Love the way that you dance, and honey, I've got a question:
Baby, would you be my queen?
All right now

Her name was Eartha was her name, I could never forget
Just like the way she dipped on the bronze-tiled floor
Honey was movin' with ease, each and every step
So good that baby had my eyes at her glow
No shiny jewelry, still the brightest thing illuminatin' the room

That girl is twistin' and a-groovin', shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me, I
Love the way that you dance, and honey, I've got a question:
Baby, would you be my queen?

Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, that baby got a golden smile, I know she's the one for me in that room

That girl is a-twistin' and a-groovin', shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me, I
Love the way that you dance, and honey, I've got a question:
Baby, would you be my queen?

Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
Mmm, that baby got a golden smile, I know she's the one for me in that room Hoping for a life more sweeter
Instead I’m just a story repeating
Why do I fear with skin dark as night?
Can’t feel peace with those judging eyes

I thought we moved on from the darker days
Did the words of the King disappear in the air
Like a butterfly?
Somebody should hand you a felony
Because you stole from me
My chance to be

Hoping for a life more sweeter
Instead I’m just a story repeating
Why do I fear with skin dark as night?
Can’t feel peace with those judging eyes

The tears of my Mother rain, rain over me
My sisters and my brothers sing, sing over me
And I wish I had another day, but it’s just another day

Hoping for a life more sweeter
Instead I’m just a story repeating
Why do I fear with skin dark as night?
Can’t feel peace with those judging eyes Hmm there she goes uh huh
She moving fast
Like a train
Somebody say babe

Fed up with my lies uh huh

Looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible
Sets me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't want to get off

Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Sitting here flossing
Peeping your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I will do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony

Until we reach the stream

Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony

Bad love left me high and dry
World is getting hotter
Lead me to the water
You know I need some

Ah ah would you kill for your own that’s how I feel in my bones
Aye la la lions goin rah rah
And you pray you’re not prey
Everyday, everyday yeah
I can’t see the world that you want me to see
I won’t be the man that you want me to be

Darkness creepin' late at night
Knows just how to talk to me when I'm tired
Feedin' on my weakness
Planted in the season when I was so young

Would you kill for your own that’s how I feel in my bones
Aye la la lions goin rah rah
And you pray you’re not prey
Everyday, everyday yeah
I can’t see the world that you want me to see
I won’t be the man that you want me to be

I won’t let the devil get over
But when the water’s boiled up and the pot starts to burn you start to understand the man
Oooh, yeah Yesterday I had nothing
Didn't know whether I've amount to something
I had holes in my shoes and in my clothes
Only yesterday
I was just a boy living amongst children
A mini guitar that I could play with
I would pretend that anything could happen
That was yesterday

That was yesterday
That was yesterday
No matter how far I've come
Still know where I'm from, oh
Never let it slip away
Still trying to figure out
What the game is all about, oh
So I take it day by day by day

Yesterday no one was listening
Today it's gonna be different
They couldn't hear my voice under the suffering
That was yesterday
Yesterday I had no direction
In my mind I had nothing but questions
I could've never dreamed of what would happen
That was yesterday

That was yesterday
That was yesterday
No matter how far I've far come
Still know where I'm from, oh
Never let it slip away
Still trying to figure out
What the game is all about, oh
So I take it day by day by day

Yesterday I was hoping
Today the future's wide open
I was lost and the signs in my mind
That was yesterday


That was yesterday
That was yesterday
That was yesterday, oh
That was yesterday
That was yesterday

People moving out, people moving in
Why? Because the color of their skin
(Run, run, run)
But you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
""Vote for me and I'll set ya free!""
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout love thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
(But the teacher)
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration
Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
Uh, yeah, that's what the world is today
Hey hey
The sale of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walking round with their heads in the sky
Cities ablaze in the summer time
Oh, the beat goes on

Evolution, revolution
Gun control, sound of soul
Shootin' rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
(And the band played on)

Round and round and round we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Oh, great googamooga, can't ya hear me talkin' to ya?

Just a ball of confusion
Oh, yeah, that's what the world is today, hey

Fear in the air
Tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on the Indian reservation
(And the band played on)

Eve of destruction
Tax deduction
City inspectors
Bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies movin' to the hills
People all over the world are shouting ""End the war""
(Shouting ""End the war"", shouting ""End the war"")

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey
Let me hear you, let me hear you say
Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey
Let me hear you, let me hear you
Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today
Let me hear you, let me hear you
Let me tell you now
Let me hear you, let me hear you say
Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today
I read it in the Bible I'm a thorn with my pride, let it burn, let it ride down on the highway
Cause I've been loving you since the first day I laid eyes on you, baby

You're my baby, girl, I need you
Be my sunshine woman, honey
Girl, let me seal this love
Oh baby, let me seal this

Oh, there's sea of many woman but you're the one that I want

With the siren, girl

So long
So long, so long
So long
See it in your eyes
(There's been a change)
I feel distant
There's been a change
A fear hangs over my head
I search for peace
In the midst of it all
What we had in those old photographs
So far gone, I gotta move on

So long, so long
So long
See it in your eyes
(There's been a change)
I feel distant
There's been a change
A fear, whoa oh, hangs from my head
It's so far gone, I gotta move on

So long, so long
So long
So long, so long
See it in your eyes
(There's been a change)
I feel distant
There's been a change A rat done bit my sister Nell
With whitey on the moon
Her face and arms began to swell
And whitey's on the moon
I can't pay no doctor bills
But whitey's on the moon
Ten years from now I'll be payin' still
While whitey's on the moon
The man just upped my rent last night
Cause whitey's on the moon
No hot water, no toilets, no lights
But whitey's on the moon
I wonder why he's upping me?
Cause whitey's on the moon?
Well I was already giving him fifty a week
With whitey on the moon
Taxes taking my whole damn check
Junkies making me a nervous wreck
The price of food is going up
And as if all that shit wasn't enough:
A rat done bit my sister Nell
With whitey on the moon
Her face and arm began to swell
And whitey's on the moon
Was all that money I made last year
For whitey on the moon?
How come I ain't got no money here?
Hmm! Whitey's on the moon
Y'know I just 'bout had my fill
Of whitey on the moon
I think I'll send these doctor bills
Airmail special
To whitey on the moon"
