"My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury's fiery
Oh, but she looks
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No ""Who cares?"", no vacant stare
No time for me

Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door


Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burning up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamp light, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power

And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free

But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

Words hung above, but never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

I'd no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Dragging along, follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth, thus transformed
By your grounded and giving and darkening scorn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is ""Stella by Starlight""
That was my heart, the drums that start off ""Night and Day""

The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, ""Is everything alright?""
And, Lord

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day…

Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem it slouched
And then, it must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you
The best of you
Honey, belongs to me

Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my baby?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you
Held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies

Ain't it warming you, the world gone up in flames?
Ain't it the life you, your lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my babe?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And Lord, she found me just in time

'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues


Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me

When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me

Since it all begun
To it's reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me
So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud, creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times, when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life

But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you

Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

There are questions I can't ask
Now at last, the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against, your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma, and the damaged love she made

But I don't know what else that I would do
Than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the god that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you

Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Feels good, girl, it feels good
Feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, that all words in the fight fell to

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Not an end, but the start of all things that are left to do

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

That's it When I was a child, I heard voices
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash


When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me
I knew this scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
Always keep them on a leash

When I was a man, I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me

A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep
Like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour
Like this morning reveals to me

And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you...

They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle show fear (So long we become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste

After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothing's gained?

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me, and if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble, marvel at flowers you'll have made

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand

And there's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eyes
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer Hell if you’d tell me
What you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me, ah

That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar I am, upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That’s the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love
(That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
Ah, oh-oh-oh, ah

That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzy
To derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe; my veins are busy
But my heart's in atrophy

Any way
To distract and sedate
Adding shadows
To the walls of the cave

You and I, nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

Something isn't right, babe; I keep catching
Little words, but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe; I keep scratching
But somehow I can't get in

So we're slaves
To any semblance of touch
Lord, we should quit
But we love it too much

Sedated, we're nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

Darlin', don't you
Stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it?
Darlin', don't you
Join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it...

Any way
To distract and sedate
Adding shadows
To the walls of the cave

You and I, nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

Sedated, we're nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dappled long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
Fretted fire but that was long ago

It's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash, I saw rise in the heat
Settled soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago

But that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
As long as amber of ember glows
All the ""would"" that I'd loved is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh,  you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh) She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

Always a well dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her

All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief


Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around (Hey, yeah)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)
That's found in the last witness
Before the wave hits, marvelling at God (Hey, yeah)
Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name 'til the fever broke
When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums

I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere
Ooh, ooh

A woman's voice
I quickly ran into the trees
With empty hands
A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no words
No sound he made

His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes were watching me
Ooh, ooh

The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Dear, in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you

I clutched my life and wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet
How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere
Ooh, ooh You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though, everywhere I go
And I've done everythin' and I've been everywhere, you know

I've been fed gold by sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I've danced real slow with Rockettes on dodgy molly

But I've had no love like your love, ooh, from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand, or the soothing of your voice

At first chance, I'd take the bed warmed by the body, woo
I once warmed my hands over a burnin' Maserati, woo

Still I've had no love like your love from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

And on the other side, why should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do, I've had no love like your love I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
But whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight, oh
But it is sunlight

All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that’s born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
And at last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight, oh sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight, sunlight

Oh, all these colors fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
Oh, all these colors fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight

Each day, you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I’d meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' of
And in a few days I would be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me is yours just as it was

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

Tell me if somehow, some of it remains
How long you would wait for me?
And how long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me 'bout your day

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
And half as beautiful too When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
(Lover, be good to me)

Be as you've always been (Lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered the sin (Lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (Lover, be good to me)
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (Lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me

When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boat sent back
When the bodies starvin' at the border
Are on TV givin' people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothin' left for you and I to do
Oh, when there’s nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)

Ah, be love in its disrepute (Lover, be good to me)
Scorches the hillside and salts every root (Lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowin’ and starvin' of troops
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (Lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (Lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
Oh, lover, be good to me

Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you’ve always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been? Rare is this love
Keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eyes, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie
Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery
To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she
But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep
Rushing to shore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that
Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps
Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it
Honey, don't feed it, it will come back
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that
I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need
Don't let me in with with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me
Honey, don't feed me, I will come back
It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh, please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I warn you, baby, each night, as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling, babe? Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it?
Any joy it would bring, honey, the look of it
Was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song or know its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
And I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of makin' noise that brought you joy?

You don't have to sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along

So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes, honey, the groove of it
Was whatever you choose
""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" or ""The Fisherman's Blues""

You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along

So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Who could ask you
Be unbroken or be brave again?
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again?
But stick around until you hear that music play again

So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?
And any joy it would bring I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still
Of every chill
Chided by the silence of the hushed sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine
Staring into blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are
Unknown we are
To the world and to the both of us
I confessed a longing I was dreaming of
Some better love

But there's no better you love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love

I have never loved a darker blue
Then the darkness I have known in you
Honed from you
You whose heart would sing in anarchy
You who'd laugh at meanings guarantees
So beautifully
When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory
Witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
Or live eternally

'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love

'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Feel better love You've done
Me wrong
For a long
Long time
But after all
You've done
I never changed
My mind
Honey please
Try to love me
Honey please
Honey try
My love will never die
Flowers
Flowers grow
Where I'm laid
To rest
Honey pick
A blossom
And hold it
Hold it
To your breast
Honey you know
That's my love
Bursting loud
From inside
My love
Oh my love my love
Will never die Any other day, I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?""
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""uh-huh"". “yeah ok""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
That I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)
Why don't you just tell the truth?
(Somebody's there then tell me who)

Why the sudden change?

What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house

And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)

Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't callin' me baby
(Say my name)
Honey, say my name Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed

But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul

I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Always, always, always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always Although many contend
You can find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Be it the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages
And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else
And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prisons
With scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time I’d walk on cloven hoof if you were the home I was walking to
I’d burn every soul I knew if I thought the fire was warming you
I’d be what men fear in the woods
I’d piss on heaven’s gate if I could
I’m straight on the level
But I’d be the devil
As long as your lovin’ was good They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
""gee my life's a funny thing, am i still too young?""
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(she)
All night
She wants the young american
Young american, young american, she wants the young american
All right
She wants the young american
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""where have all papa's heroes gone?""
(she)
All the way from washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""we live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""
(he)
All night
He wants the young american
Young american, young american, he wants the young american
All right
He wants the young american
Do you remember, your president nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?
Have you have been an un-american?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have
(you)
All night
You want the young american
Young american, young american, you want the young american
All right
You want the young american
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a cadi and a lady got a chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(i heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman i can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child i can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?
(i) (repeat 3 times)
All night
I want the young american
Young american, young american, i want the young american
All right
I want the young american Lyrics will follow upon release... I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been

Tell me how it feels, bet it's such a bitter pill
And yeah I know, you thought you had bigger, better things
Bet right now this stings

Bright as Technicolor, I can tell that you can see
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to, I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can’t you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it, I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I’ve got (Ah)

One less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh-oh-oh)

And I know you're never gonna wake up, I have to give up, but it's you
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back, but it's you
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it, but it's you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got (Ah)
Ooh
Ooh, Ah


Got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

If you know like I know
You don’t wanna step to this
It’s the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

Got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh-oh-oh)

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh) Yes I do, I believe
One day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, these days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh, but the feeling is much too strong

Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Mmm

Reaching out to you
Oh, can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you like crazy, like crazy, like crazy

Told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh, but the feeling is much too strong

Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight


Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight

Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!


Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place (Sing praises)
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace (Brotherhood)
This holy tide of Christmas
All beauty in disgrace
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to, nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
Move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to
Move me, baby
Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

Oh, Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
And good God, let me give you my life I still watch you when you're groovin'

You're movin' without movin'

Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby

You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I'll move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby

And when you move, I'm moved


When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all, all
I'll take your part, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'm on your side, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you ever need a friend
I'm sailing behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoeing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

It’s not what’s in front but who’s beside you
It’s all that came before and what it provides you
All those that held the line
Who wouldn’t bow down and resign
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising

And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, lord
Nina cried power
James Brown cried power
Lennon cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Ah (Power, lord)
Joni cried power
Julie cried power
Nina cried power

And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free (power)

And I could cry power (power)
Power is my love when my love reaches to me (power, love)
James Brown cried power
Curtis cried power
Marvin cried power
Ah, power (power)
Power (power)
(Power, love)
Nina cried power, power, power
Nina cried power If towers fall, if nothing stands
I’ll build again the world by my baby’s hands
At the end of all, there’s all they claim and then

I saw the news again
To hear that the world’s to end in flames
I’d not complain, I’ve seen the love of my baby
Be on the take, or talkin’ of slaughter over cake
Would kneel and break
Speak of the love of my baby

If towers fall, if nothing stands
I’ll build again the world by my baby’s hands
At the end of all, there’s all they claim and then

The angels can know their place
Let heaven hidе its face in sheer disgrace
Oh, look upon the lovе of my baby
Those who wield the chain
Are pushing the wheels of fear and shame
Forget their name
Hear of the love, the love, the love

If towers fall, if nothings stands
I’d build again the world by my baby’s hands
The unamable, the unmade again
And then

So hurry up and start
Can’t wait for the world to fall apart
‘Cus here unmarked
Would still be the love, the love, the love yeah girl
ah ha ha ha
uh hehe Don't want to discuss it
I think it's time for a change
You may get disgusted
Start thinkin' that I'm strange
In that case I'll go underground
Get some heavy rest
Never have to worry
About what is worst and what is best (get it)
Oh oh Domino (all right)
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Lord have mercy
I said oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say it again
I said oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino, dig it
There's no need for argument
There's no argument at all
And if you never hear from him
That just means he didn't call or vice versa
That depends on wherever you're at
Or and if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not
Oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Lord have mercy
I said oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say it again
Oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino
