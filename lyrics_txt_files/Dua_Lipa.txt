"One, one, one, one, one

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him If you don't wanna see me

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a)

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart? Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you


You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready

Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)

Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Physical (Physical, physical)
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical Ah yeah
Ah yeah

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know I'm wanted
Can’t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell 3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun starts rising

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning? It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)

When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight

I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Hey!)

Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)

(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Mmm)
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed Future

I know you like this beat 'cause Jeff's been doin' the damn thing
You wanna turn it up loud, Future Nostalgia is the name (Future nostalgia)

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)

Can't be a rolling stone if you live in a glass house (Future nostalgia)
You keep on talking that talk, one day, you're gonna blast out
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face (Future nostalgia)
You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth

My sound, my sound, my sound
(Future, future nostalgia) I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again) I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily, tread

This is not a, this is not a
Swan (Tread heavily), swan song (Tread)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (Tread heavily), swan song (Tread)
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight (Tread heavily)
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

It's a new life Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

Pretty

Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

Pretty please Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

And I need some new love
New love, new love

Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance Guess I never had a love like this (Ah-ha)
Hit me harder than I ever expected (Ooh)
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night (Ah-ha)

We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

I like us better when we're intertwined (Ah-ha)
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Hey)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine (Ah-ha)
You got me working up an appetite-tite

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know
That I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favourite, my ride or die, oh

No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

Wanna be right where you are
Let's go dancing in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit
(Make me lose my mind)

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

No goodbyes

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah

I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to

Ah-ooh
My body, my body, my body (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
Yeah (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to (Eh la, eh la, it's my body) Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This Garden of Eden?
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden) I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play""

Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me down Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love


Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you Last night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

In my dreams
You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is tickin', we gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight
Hey

Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

In my dreams
You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

Yeah
In my dreams
Yeah
In my dreams You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the truth's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

Yeah
Talk every day, like we best friends
Every time we out on a date, we're engaged
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her ""What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?""
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayers You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles

Got me running, running, ooh

Got me running, running, ooh

Got me running, running, ooh

So watch it blow when I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Tell me what you're drinking, cuh

I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

Good times, there gon' be some good times
'Member used to pull up, and let 'em fight?
That's that hood time
'Member used to hold on your hand when nobody would time?
Yeah, I know that bitch trippin', she ain't got that much time
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She tryna copy my shit, but she be missin' the hits
Wanna go fast? Wanna race me?
We gon' ball, Walter Payton
We gon' fly through the stations
Come here bae, you're a blessin'
And from you, I learn my lesson
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this
But she can't get it locked up like locksmith
Watch her come to my lights, like a reindeer
Me and papi on the same pills
My diamonds, never stand still
Where you goin'? Why you ain't here?
You sold your soul for the mass appeal

I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

We be ridin' like a mothafuckin' stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm colored red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God, I can't never sideline shorty
She, she said she likes all of my man's rhymes
Where is my phone? That money be callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summertime, me and shawty hustle
I swear to God, I'ma tip you, got to struggle
Baby girl, sit it down, you not known like an usher
I told lil' baby, ""I don't bite but my teeth do.""
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free, Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time you do too

I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

Real bad, baby
I can't afford the fancy, fancy places, oh
But long as you have faith in me
We'll have ourselves Gimme release
Keep the drugs
Gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don’t judge, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight

Guess what?
Hella, hella, it’s my body right

Hella, hella, it’s my body
I’ll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it’s my body
Hella, hella, it’s my body

Some people do
But some, they just like to talk (okay)
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark (okay)
Some need the light
And some people like the dark (okay, yeah)

I won’t stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it’s my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, it’s my body
I’ll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it’s my body

To do what I want
Any old time
I say
Love me, hold me
Love me, hold me
‘Cause I’m free
To do what I want
Any old time I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I’m all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
That one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms, ’cause

I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Lo-oh-oh-ove
Lo-oh-oh-ove
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Lo-oh-oh-ove
Lo-oh-oh-ove
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
(Love is a religion!)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion!)
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me (Me)
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need (Need)
They say love is religion (Oh-oh, whoa)
So say a prayer with me
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me (Me)
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Love is a religion! Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, ""Fuck me""
Tonight, she yelling, ""Fuck me""
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me

Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass

I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses, yeah 서로의 눈치만 보지만
네 속마음 들킨걸 아는걸
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
감정을 속이려 하는 너
시간 없어 넌 just wasting time
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree, bae?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

이 밤은 흘러가고
더는 숨기려고 해도 의미없어
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
이 방의 문을 닫고
둘이 서만 함께 하는 이 공간에서
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Hold on
너와 나의 케미
Come on, hold on
거부할 수 없어
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on
Just a little tighter
Come on, hold on
Tell me if you're ready
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)

Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Physical (Physical, physical)
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he never loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I, I, I)

I got new rules, I count 'em, baby
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
(I'm tellin' 'em to myself, I'm tellin' 'em to myself)
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(I'm tellin' 'em to myself)
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to, and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish
Don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

Hmm
Oh-oh-oh here, here
Hmm
Here, here
Are we over here? Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby Gotta get something off of my chest, can I get a witness?
Yeah, I got tattoos all on my skin, but scared of commitment
And I keep saying that I love you, I wish you would listen
I wish you would listen
But there's something missin', mh

You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?

If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

I don't wanna have to choose between you or having my freedom
Baby, I don't wanna let go of us or what I believe in
I don't wanna feel like I need to leave, don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
You know that I mean it, mh

You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?

If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely, oh oh yeah (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Just one thing that's on my mind)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(Yeah, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)

Ahh, if I lose myself
Ahh, yeah
If I give a little more of me
Would I lose myself completely?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Oh, ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I give you, if I give you, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, trop occupée pour t'écouter
Va trouver quelqu'un d'autre à saouler
Comme quoi je n'étais pas la seule à avoir le dos tourné

Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est ça ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
Même quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas

Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Je me fous de c'qu'elle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a fuck
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?
Boy, I don't give a fuck

Je m'en fous de tes états d'âme
Viens pas faire un caprice, viens pas en faire un drame
Ravale tes mots doux, ils font partie du passé
Tu peux faire demi-tour, je ne reviendrai pas

Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
I'll tell you why!

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up (too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (boy, I don't give a)

Je me fous de c'qu'elle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a fuck
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?
Boy, I don't give a fuck Count 'em, count 'em, count 'em, count 'em, count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
Count 'em, count 'em, count 'em, count 'em, count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
Too many times, too many times
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
I never learn, (I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?

Hang on ball and chain (Ooh)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Ooh)
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you)

It ain't about the money, don't matter where you're from
Don't care 'bout what you believe in
Or who you wanna love
Let's get back to basics, before we turn to dust
Forget about all the illusions
Tonight it's us

Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Sweat drippin' out our body, that's how we shed our pain
The monsters waiting outside, like poison for the brain
Things get a little bit crazy, don't need to feel ashamed
There's no more time for cryin'
You can be our DJ
Play our worries away
You can be our savior
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Trapped inside the rhythm world, I feel free
Let me be your prisoner
Suffocated by the beat, lets me breathe
Keep on lightin' me up, keep on lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you, need you)
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Hang on)
How we dancin', we’ll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Hang on)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life What are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?

All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
(Eh-eh-ah-eh)

All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yourY
(I wanna, wanna be) yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh I've been winning since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you about to get much sicker
Cause I'm looking in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Beggin' baby, hands is poppin', wrists with six plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, taking meetings in L.A
Glowing up and blowing up, that's what I'm about to do
When it's all been happening since I left you

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, and I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept a hundred, man, you shoulda kept it real
Cause I realize you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck The more I love you, the more I rip you apart
That's what you said when we were arguing
I gave you so much love, I left none for myself
And you took it all away and threw it right back, right back

You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
I'm allowed to hang out with my friends and without you
You're so in denial (Denial, denial)
And I'm so over you (You)
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

It's you and your ego that's fighting for the crown
Maybe that is just your insecurity
I gave you attention, left nothing for myself
And you threw it all away, and I said ""Fuck that"" (Fuck that)
Fuck that

You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

They've been blowin' my phone
I've been busy gettin' busy for I don't know how long
They think I'm missin'
But the only thing missin' is my clothes (Ooh)
My clothes (Ooh)

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say ""Ooh"", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)

25/8, 25/8

Call it insomnia, but this is just the thing that I like
'Cause when you're on me, I get hungry, got a big appetite
Wanna feel the rush, runnin' through my blood
Baby, don't open the blinds (Ooh)
All night (Ooh)

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me

To do the things I want to do
We gon' need all the extra power
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom, zoom)

No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more You don't know what you've lost 'til it's gone
You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends

Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise

Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down We're kissin’ on the concrete floor, the third day of the rave
Berlin summer, I knew I loved you then
Fireworks lit the sky, we're runnin' through a burnin’ field
Baby, just you and I

If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh yeah

I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It's cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

We're runnin' down the country road in 2018
It was only you and me, and nothin' in between (Oh I, oh yeah)
And the trees are movin', in slow motion
Drunk and dancin'

If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh yeah

I’ll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It’s cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, hmm
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Berlin summer
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Berlin summer

If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
Oh yeah

I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It’s cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, yeah)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, hmm) If you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift

Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you
I'd fight for you
When you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift

Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

When you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you
When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight?

Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Et depuis quelque temps nos relations n’sont pas terribles
Pourtant je te console comme on le voit dans les films
Comment tu veux qu’j’le prenne quand tu m’appelles « mon chéri »
Alors qu’il y a quelques minutes on était comme sur un ring
Et tu sais bien qu’j’aime pas qu’on se prenne la tête devant nos amis
Alors prends ta veste et rejoins-moi tout de suite derrière la son-mai
J’crois qu’il est temps qu'on récolte tout ce qu’on a semé
Depuis toutes ces années, on s’demandait où ça nous menait

Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est ça ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
Même quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas

J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up (too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (boy, I don't give a)

Je me fous de c'qu'elle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a fuck
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?
Boy, I don't give a fuck Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

Will you protect me from the things that I want?
Will you be down and leave the second we're done?
I got one thing I want, I know that it's wrong

But I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

The taste of chaos on the tip of my tongue
I kinda like the crazy girl I've become
It's about time that I just have me some fun

'Cause I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
(I got a bad idea, ha)

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

No, I can't help myself (Ah)
Haha
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I don't care because I like it (I like it)
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
But I won't stop because I like it

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
(I got a bad idea)
It's a bad idea (No, no, no)
But I can't help myself (Help myself), no, I can't help myself (Help myself)
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself (Help myself), so I'll just help myself to you

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
Why's it so much better when we're not together? (Not together)
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
(I got a bad idea) Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to

Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through Homegirl on the road, she doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe
I only love you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just keep my business on the low-low
You gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Love started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all those and their mothers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe
I only love you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, boy, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe
I only love you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me
'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe

That's the real me, babe Hey!
Mmh, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah

Why should I go and settle for glitter
When I could shine like gold?
Why should I wait around and just sit here
When I could save my soul?

That kind of woman I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some

Came here just to sing for Clara
Lookin' for the baddest diva
Hol' up, let me analyse her, body lookin' like a hypnotiser
Come let me try some, suttin' you can climb on
Oh, you're a shy one, who you tryna hide from?
Baby, jump in the black ride and put your friend in the white one
I'm a Benzo addict, pulled up in traffic
Me and my friends switched cars and it looked like magic
They never seen such a skinny man in a big puffer jacket
That's unfamiliar, I came lookin' like a bodybuilder
Out here's windy, yana, you're the one that I'm into, yana
Don't you wanna see the interior?

Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some, oh hey

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe, hey

Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some Cab radio screaming
Noise and tears
Death on the TV
And then there's you
Messed up, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline...
Mhmm

Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh

Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then there's you
Venus in Converse
You put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us

Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey

Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster
Me and you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh

Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days I look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing

Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears

Then you take my hand and suddenly, I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears  See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fighting again

So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Let's go

I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen

So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smoking, oh

So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinking or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Leggo

Thug love, thug love, thug love Met a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase

He said ""girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon""

I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said ""ooh""
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

Another thing that he told me
""It’s gonna be a long, long daylight""
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase

He said ""girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon""

I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said ""ooh""
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

No matter what he said to me
I’m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Ooh

Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said ""ooh""
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore

And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure

And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

Make it hard to talk and see
I'm just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they’re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted

And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that

I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing had to zen me more
And I like that, kinda like that
Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure

And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I...

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
(Don't let him in, don't let him in - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Don't be his friend, don't be his friend - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I gotta tell them to myself
(Don't let him in, don't let him in - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Don't be his friend, don't be his friend - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I gotta tell them to myself Lyrics from Snippet
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Don't you wear your own mouth?
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think you'd ever change?
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
And I tried, and I tried, and I tried
But it just doesn't feel right
Like a night, like a night, like a night
With a sunrise
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
You are looking two faced
You need another pair of shades All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, ""Show me something""
He said, ""If you dare, come a little closer""

'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Funny, you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, I want you to stay
I want you to stay, I want you to stay Sippin' on that purple lid
Gangsta boy got me so mean
Come, let’s get a little wilder
Let's wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
I promise you, you'll never forget
What feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder

My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

I'll kiss all the ink on your neck
'Cause baby, I'm doing it, and you do it the best
Light up, let's get a little louder
Hold me for a little longer
I love it when you whisper in my ear
Tell me things I always wanna hear
You're the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer

My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

Let it all down, down, down, down
Let me say hi, hi, hi, hi
Never gonna ground, ground, ground
Never say goodbye, bye, bye, bye

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
I'll be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

Favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl I-It's your voo...
I-It's your voo...

I can't get away
Found a home in your heartbeat
I keep coming back again
There's a madness that surrounds me
And when you're a thousand miles away
I'm holding on for you
I get on my knees to pray
'Cause I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
(I-It's your voo...)
Is this what they call love?
'Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo
(I-It's your voo...)

You're my heavy rain
You drench me off of nothing
For all you gotta say, at least can you mean something?
And when you're a thousand miles away, what am I supposed to do?
It's strange, 'cause your love stayed
I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo
(It's your) It's your voodoo
(I-It's your voo...)
Is this what they call love?
'Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo
(I-It's your voo...)

(I-It's your voo...)
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
(I-It's your voo...)
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo

Why won't you let me go?
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out
Why won't you let me go?
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out

It's your voodoo (voodoo, voodoo)
(It's your) It's your voodoo (voodoo, voodoo)
(I-It's your voo...)
Is this what they call love? (voodoo, voodoo)
'Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo (voodoo, voodoo)
(I-It's your voo...)

(Voodoo, voodoo)
It's your voo...
(Voodoo, voodoo)
Is this what they call love?
(Voodoo, voodoo)
Must be voodoo
(Voodoo, voodoo) In the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Don’t matter what’s written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun stops rising

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning? Oh, oh

While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of hope and dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me are we meant to be

Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time (time, time)
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial

Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

Don't you beg me for forgiveness
Don't mistake my love for weakness

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All or nothing Your kiss, your touch, your hold
You know I want you all
The darkness in my soul
Tells me to let you go

And I
Need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you

So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
New York
Save me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home

I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy

She never sleeps at night
So nice you name her twice
Without you I'm alive
But my heart is cold as ice

And I
Need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you

So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
New York
Save me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home

I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy

I ran away from home
I ran to follow my deams
I ran away from he
Why would he do this to me?
I needed a way out
I needed to figure how
To keep get you here with me
Maybe you are my dream

So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
New York
Save me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home

I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
Got my head spinnin', no kiddin', I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh One, one, one, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)

You're gettin' over him Oh
In my heart
I know we might be sharing time
I lost my mind, they say I know it’s hot
I know we've got
Something that money can’t buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, the same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don’t like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don’t like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don’t fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign

Open the door
If you want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, the same me
Inside

I'm your top, top dollar (Ah, ah) What a year for dating, crazy
Nothin' is the way it was
People textin' exes sex pics
From the basement at their mom's

If you have human contact
Don't know what you'll contract
So your first date's always on Zoom (Oh)
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
Girl, you're drunk on FaceTime
WiFi's gettin' sloppy

There's no bars, there's no school
Poundin' claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friends

No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When you've gotten your face off Netflix
Hulu, HBO, and Prime

Now you're lookin' ready
Though, it's low-key scary
Check your drip and grab your Lysol (Oh)

If you're ever wanna see another person's body
If you zap on your forehead, you're a total hottie

Wear a mask, wash your hands
It's not like you have other plans
It's awkward, but it's cool
Following all these COVID rules (COVID rules)

One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone
Two: Stalk their Instagram
Gotta background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin' game
No one's seen you naked since February
And if you hit it off, watch out if they start to cough
I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
Masks can be irritating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: There's a new third base, that's when you get to see their lower face
Two:  Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick 'em when you wake up in the morning
You're feelin' numb, it's you, your hand, and OnlyFans

We've got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
It's your neighbors you're saving
You'll get that touch you're craving
Just follow these rules for dating Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new, I got new
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new, I got new
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I-I-I-I-I-I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities

Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him And I can't tell you how this story ends
And I can't pretend
Blame it on the night, one too many at the dark
Saw you called a thousand times
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

About you

'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

About you

Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

(You, You)
(You, You)

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(I can't stop thinking 'bout youuuuu)
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you


I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(You, You)

         Hey

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
If you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees, please
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(Hey)

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

         I don't know, don't know how it seems but
I ain't tryna take your freedom
I just wanna know where your heart's at
'Cause it's been so long since you text back
Got me wondering what happened
I see them pictures of you laughing
I don't wanna run out of time to
Tell you how I feel about you

No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to

Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

You let me, let me, let mе love you
But only, only when you want to
It's good that we'rе both staying busy
I just wanna know if you miss me
Take a second and imagine
See it all before it happens
If you feel the vibe, make it times two
You don't have to ask, you know I do, ooh

No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to

Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

I've been waiting for you to give me something
All my patience, don't let it be for nothing
I've been (I've been) waiting (Waiting)
For you to give me something
I'm just asking you to

Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

         I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules (keep pushin')
I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em,  I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em,  I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may– (So)
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–, may–, may– (Oh)
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may– (So)
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–


Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may– (So)
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–, may–, may– (Oh)
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may– (So)
May–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–, may–
May–, may–, may–

         I turn tables and speak too softly
I don't make much sense, I don’t make much sense
You're unable to calm down lightly
You're so intense, yeah you’re so intense

So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home

You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn’t work but it does
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us

You’re too playful, and never serious
But I love you that way, yeah I love you that way
I'm too careful and always in a rush
But it’s all okay, yeah it's always okay Boy, I don't give a fuck

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen

(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck) Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Let's get physical
Come on, let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)

Oh, when you're looking at the sun
Not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, cause you got inside my head

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show

No, I won't let you down
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down  Lyrics to snippet

You were for me right now, right now, right now
Ha-aah Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)

If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
(I wanna do) More
(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

Finally I can see what my heart needs now
Hold my hand, dance with me, we can paint this town
What are we waiting for?
Time to live out loud (Eh-eh-ah-eh)

If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
(I wanna do) More
(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more

(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a...
(I'm a big boss and you a tiny man)
Shut up

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love


Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall

Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll t-t-tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So) Let's get physical
Phy-phy-phy-physical

All night, I'll riot with you

Let's get physical  Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)

If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

Oh, I want it all (Hey)
I'm talking 'bout everything I've ever dreamed of
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I want it all
(Oh, I want it) All
(Oh, I want it, want it) All
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

Finally I can see what my heart needs now
Hold my hand, dance with me, we can paint this town
What are we waiting for?
Time to live out loud (Eh-eh-ah-eh)

If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

Oh, I want it all (Hey)
I'm talking 'bout everything I've ever dreamed of
Oh, I want it all (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I want it all
(Oh, I want it) All
(Oh, I want it, want it) All

I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

         I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me

This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

It's a new life If you don't wanna see me

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now
Don't start now
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)
So I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
Not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
Cause I could be the one

I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, cause you got inside my head

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
Cause I could be the one Da-ba-da-da-di-da
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
What you, what you gon' do
Falling, fallin'

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do, do me
If I would've known it, baby

Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

Break my heart
Break my heart
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
One that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""

'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart? Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

I've been drinking
Baby that's, baby that's why I'm feeling
So mistaken
All this love, all this love got me bad
Hallucinating
Everytime that you're next to me
I'm losing patience
So can we go, can we go home alone?

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Take the touch and
Just give a little love and affection
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
I hate the pressure
There wasn't any when I met you
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up

Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up But you know, baby, I'm a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
Ooh, act of God
Don't know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can't control it Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

Hotter than hell

I'm giving you that pleasure

I'm giving you that pleasure
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell

And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell Inside

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

Ni-ni-night I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside

(Hey) Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Dive, swan dive
Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Dive
Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Dive

What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning lnow

This is not a, this is not a... swan song
This is not a, this is not a... swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
(Swan dive)
It's a new life

Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Dive
Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Drive, swan dive
Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Swan song, swan song, swan dive
Nothing at all, nothing at all

The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

This is not a, this is not a... yeah, it's a new life
Swan song
This is not a, this is not a... swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, It's a new life

         I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then why are we wasting time?
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then why are we wasting time?
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me

Hey!

You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I should've stayed at home
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

What is the point (what is the point) of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
Watching it fall, watching it fall

Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down

Let's get physical Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance I, I can't lie, I’m scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothin' at all, nothin’ at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doin' nothin' at all, watchin' it fall?

The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
’Cause staying silent’s the same as dyin'
I won’t stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

         3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em, ey
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, (What do I say?)
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em, hey
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new rules, I count 'em)

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em (I love you guys)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Alright, we're gonna need to sing this toegther
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Why? You're gettin' over him
That's right! Call my name
Call my name
Call my name
Call my name

Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know
That I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name

Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favourite, my ride or die, oh
Yeah, I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much

         Hey

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why, sing

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(One more time)

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck (Mmm)

Let's go dancing in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips

Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion

There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause

I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes

They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion

They say love is religion

They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion

Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't need your love
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't need your love

'Cause of you
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love
(Boy, I don't give a)

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't need your love
So stop tryna get to me (Get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't need your love One, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I, I, I)
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em (baby you know I count 'em)
I've gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
You ain't getting over him

         Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

Yeah, we don't know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu—

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman
That kind of woman

One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to me
I want you to myself
No, I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one

I'll be the first to say
""Baby, what's your name?""
'Cause I want ya
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman, woman

That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman
That kind of woman

'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya

That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

That kind of woman

(I'm Gonna)
Keep you close, next to me
I won't let you go
(You're gonna)
Reminisce
That you once met a girl like this
I'll be the first to say, the first to say, the first to say, the first to say
That kind of woman
The first to say, the first to say, the first to say, the first to say
That kind of woman, woman
The first to say, the first to say, the first to say, the first to say
That kind of woman, woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman, woman

That kind of woman Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

         I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
I would've stayed at home
I would've
Stayed at home

Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Better alone
Better alone
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time (I know)
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby (Baby)

Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart
Break my heart (ooh, ooh)
Break my heart (ooh, ooh)
Break my heart (Ooh, ooh)
Break my heart (ooh, ooh)

Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
(I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
Better alone Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family

         Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not whеre you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see mе dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
Walk away, walk away
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody (Somebody)
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me (Stop me)

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh
Walk away, oh
Walk away

         Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-L

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-L

Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical

(P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-L)
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
All night, I'll riot with you

So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on

Physical (Physical, physical)
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical

         Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold еach other, use each othеr, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes Yeah, and alone
Oh, out again
Bed in the morning
I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me

Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change

Did a full 180, Crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each othеr mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Pleasе, come take it out on me

But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance Guess I never had a love like this
Hit me harder than I ever expected
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going till we see the sunlight

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess wе're ready for the summеr

I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Ah-ah)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me working up an appetite-tite

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em

I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)

(I gotta tell them to myself)

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

You're gettin' over him (Fox!)
If you don't wanna see me

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

And I need some new love
New love, new love

Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?

Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's I never, 'cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
