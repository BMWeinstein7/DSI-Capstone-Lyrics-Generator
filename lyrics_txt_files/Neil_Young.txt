"Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate
See it shining in your eye

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon


Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old


I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old


Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?

Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio

Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?

I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?


Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!

I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long? My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey

Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
An' once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my Oh, Alabama
The devil fools
With the best laid plan
Swing low, Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now, the moment
Is all that it meant

Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh, Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows, down in Alabama
See the old folks
Tied in white robes
Hear the banjo
Don't it take you down home?


Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh, Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand?
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing, Alabama?
You got the rest of the Union
To help you along
What's going wrong? There’s colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world


We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world


Keep on rockin' in the free world Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s

I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin'
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loadin' had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done

I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out

I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?

I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream

Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream

Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around Think I'll pack it in
And buy a pick-up
Take it down to ""L.A.""
Find a place to call my own
And try to fix up
Start a brand new day

The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say


She got pictures on the wall
They make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road
Trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head

The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
Oh Sailin' hardships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

Tell me why
Tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

Tell me why
Tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

Tell me why
Tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell? Did I see you down in a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain

Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

Did I see you walking with the boys?
Though it was not hand in hand
And was some black face in a lonely place
When you could understand?

Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past, will we lose our grasp?
Or fuse it in the sun?

Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon Hello, cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet sweet smile?

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn bad

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

Hello, woman of my dreams
This is not the way it seems
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are fallin'
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away

I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face 'em day-to-day
Though my problems are meaningless
That don't make them go away
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day

I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm livin' out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still out of reach
Went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone

Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
I follow the road though I don't know where it ends
Get out of town, get out of town
Think I'll get out of town

Because the world is turnin'
I don't wanna see it turn away She used to work in a diner
Never saw a woman look finer
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town
Never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too

Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

You know it ain't easy
You got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids
Looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes

Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes


Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes I got to bet
That your old man
Became fascinated
With his own plan
Turned you loose
Your mama too
There wasn't a thing
That you could do
But I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through
I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through

You really made my day
With the little things you say

Looking through
The window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I can't find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to look out for
The greedy hand, greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
There's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window

Who was it made
Your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby
How'd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms
And I really
Took you down the track
Now all I've got for you
Is the kind of love
That cuts clean through
All I got for you is razor love
It cuts clean through My life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin' from door to door
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid

It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold

To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again?

A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin' a part that I could understand

A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid

When will I see you again? Back in the old folky days
The air was magic when we played
The riverboat was rocking in the rain
Midnight was the time for the raid
Oh, Isabela, proud Isabela
They tore you down and plowed you under
You're only real with your make-up on
How could I see you and stay too long?
All along the Navajo Trail
Burn-outs stub their toes
On garbage pails
Waitresses are crying in the rain
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?
Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skids
Shoe ain't happy, neither are the kids
She needs someone that she can scream at
And I'm such a heel for making her feel so bad
I guess I'll call it sickness gone
It's hard to say the meaning of this song
An ambulance can only go so fast
It's easy to get buried in the past
When you try to make a good thing last
I saw today in the entertainment section
There's room at the top for private detection
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter
But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper
So all you critics sit alone
You're no better than me for what you've shown
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
We could get together for some scenes

I never knew a man could tell so many lies
He had a different story for every set of eyes
How can he remember who he's talking to?
Because I know it ain't me and I hope it isn't you

Well, I'm up in T.O. keeping jive alive
And out on the corner it's half past five
But the subways are empty
And so are the cafes
Except for the Farmer's Market
And I still can hear him say:
You're all just pissing in the wind
You don't know it but you are
And there ain't nothing like a friend
Who can tell you you're just pissing in the wind They were hiding behind hay bales
They were planting
In the full moon
They had given all they had
For something new
But the light of day was on them
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water
Shone like diamonds in the dew

And I was just getting up
Hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw
Those thrashers rolling by
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feeling
Like my day had just begun

Where the eagle glides descending
There's an ancient river bending
Through the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates

It was then I knew I'd had enough
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement
Turns to sand
With a one-way ticket
To the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends
I still don't understand

They had the best selection
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting

So I got bored and left them there
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road
Without that load
Brings back the time
When I was eight or nine
I was watching my mama's T.V
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode

Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums
Galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar

But me I'm not stopping there
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line
In the field of time
When the thrashers come
I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs in shrines
But I'll know the time has come
To give what's mine Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all right

I've got my friends in the world
I had my friends
When we were boys and girls
And the secrets came unfurled

City of brotherly love
Place I call home
Don't turn your back on me
I don't want to be alone
Love lasts forever
Someone is talking to me
Calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame
I won't be ashamed of love
Philadelphia
City of brotherly love
Brotherly love

Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all right On the roller coaster ride
That my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry
Through the night

I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall
Of digital sound
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul

A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

Amazon
You had so much
And now so much is gone
What are you going to do
With your life?
What a lucky man
To see the earth
Before it touched his hand
What an angry fool
To condemn
One more night to go
One more sleep
Upon your burning banks
A greedy man never knows
What he's done

A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls
Lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet
A brand new pair of seamless pants
We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul

A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature Someone and someone were down by the pond
Looking for something to plant in the lawn
Out in the fields, they were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the windows and out on the road
They're bringing me presents and saying hello

Singing words, words between the lines of age
Words, words between the lines of age


If I was a junkman selling you cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder? And how would it seem?
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme

Singing words, words between the lines of age
Words, words between the lines of age Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are looking good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way Well, we live in a trailer at the edge of town
You never see us because we don't come around
We got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down
But we need you now and that's why
I'm hanging around
So you be good to me and I'll be good to you
And in this land of conditions
I'm not above suspicion
I won't attack you but I won't back you
Well, it's so good to be here asleep on your lawn
Remember your guard dog?
Well, I'm afraid that he's gone
It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long
Yes, that was me with the doves setting them free near the factory
Where you built your computer love
I hope you get the connection because I can't take the rejection
I won't deceive you, I just don't believe you
Well, I'm a barrel of laughs with my carbine on
I keep 'em hopping until my ammunition's gone
But I'm still not happy
I feel like there's something wrong
I got the revolution blues
I see bloody fountains
And ten million dune buggies coming down the mountains
Well, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars
But I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their cars Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

They killed us in our teepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Crying on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun

They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share

I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire

Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well, late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long

Tonight's the night
Yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Yes, it is
Tonight's the night

Early in the morning, at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
Because, people, let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline

Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Well, early in the morning
Just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon

Tonight's the night
Yes, it is

Whoa One of these days
I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
And I'm going to try
And thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown

One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

And I'm going to thank
That old country fiddler
And all those rough boys
Who play that rock 'n' roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go

One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

From down in L.A
All the way to Nashville
From New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak, some are strong

One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

Nestled in your wings, my little one
This special morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over Comes a time when you're drifting
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light, feelings lifting
Lift that baby right up off the ground

Oh, this old world
Keeps spinning round
It's a wonder tall trees
Ain't layin' down
There comes a time

You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away From Hank to Hendrix
I walked these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar
Doing what I do
I always expected
That you should see me through
I never believed in much
But I believed in you

Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

From Marilyn to Madonna
I always loved your smile
Now we're headed
For the big divorce
California-style
I found myself singing
Like a long-lost friend
The same thing that makes you live
Can kill you in the end

Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?

Sometime it's distorted
Not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love
Just comes ringing through
New glass in the window
New leaf on the tree
New distance between us
You and me

Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride? He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner


There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something
That he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner I hear some people been talking me down
Bring up my name, pass it around
They don't mention the happy times
They do their thing, I do mine
Ooh baby that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real

Walk on, walk on 

I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night getting crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could
Ooh baby that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real Song without a home

When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I won't be back 'til February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past

When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind? Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in

I was thinking of you and me
Making love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be
Thinking about the times we had
Some were good and some were bad
Guitar fighting the T.V

I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me

Looking at you just the other night
Dancing in the evening light
True love conquers all
Old man sitting there
Touch of grey, but he don't care
When he hears his children call

I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me

Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in I'm an accident, I was driving way too fast
Couldn't stop though, so I let the moment last
I'm for rolling, I'm for tossing in my sleep
It's not guilt though, it's not the company I keep

People my age, they don't do the things I do
They go somewhere while I run away with you
And I've got my friends, and I've got my family too
And I got her love, she's got my love too

And I can't hear you, but I feel the things you say
And I can't see you, but I see what's in my way
Now I'm floating, 'cause I'm not tied to the ground
Words I've spoken seem to leave a hollow sound

On the long plain, see the rider in the night
See the chieftain, see the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them when they take another life?
Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife?

Voicemail numbers on an old computer screen
Rows of lovers, parked forever in a dream
Screaming sirens echoing across the bay
To the old boats from the city far away

Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns
And rows of zeros on a field that's turning brown
They play baseball, they play football under lights
They play card games and we watch them every night
Need distraction, need romance and candlelight
Need random violence, need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence, want the testimony of
Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love

I was too tired to see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain, fell into bed alone
Started dreaming, saw the rider once again
In the doorway, where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him

I'm not present, I'm a drug that makes you dream
I'm an aerostar, I'm a cutlass supreme
In the wrong lane, trying to turn against the flow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow

I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow Motion pictures on my TV screen
A home away from home living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
I've got mine
I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is falling
The ducks are calling
Yes, I've got mine
Well, all those people, they think they got it made
But I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow or trade
Anything I have to be like one of them
I'd rather start all over again
Well, all those headlines, they just bore me now
I'm deep inside myself, but I'll get out somehow
And I'll stand before you
And I'll bring a smile to your eyes
Motion pictures  Well he shot four men in a cocaine deal
And he left them lying in an open field
Full of old cars with bullet holes in the mirrors
He tried to do his best but he could not

Please take my advice 
Open up the tired eyes 

Well, it wasn't supposed to go down that way
But they burned his brother, you know
And they left him lying in the driveway
They let him down with nothing
He tried to do his best but he could not


Well tell me more, tell me more, tell me more
I mean was he a heavy doper or was he just a loser?
He was a friend of yours
What do you mean, he had bullet holes in his mirrors?
He tried to do his best but he could not King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know

I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
There in my truck the dog and I
Then one day the King up and died
Then I thought about the times we had
Once when I kicked him when he was bad
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history

King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know

That old King was a friend of mine
Never knew a dog that was half as fine
I may find one, you never do know
Because I still got a long way to go
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history

King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know All the sailors with their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
Singing songs for pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars at the door

You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter

All the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade


All the Bush League batters
Are left to die on the diamond
In the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles  I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, babe, sell you twenty barrels worth

I'm a black bat, babe, banging on your window pane
I'm a black bat, babe, banging on your window pane
Well, I'm a black bat, babe, I need my high octane

Good times are coming, I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are coming, I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are coming, but they sure coming slow

I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, babe, sell you twenty barrels worth
Good times are coming You are such a woman to me
And I love you
Our love will live
Until the end of all time

No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you

You are such a woman to me I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

Traffic cops are all color blind
People steal from their own kind
Evening comes too early for a stroll
Down neon streets the streaker streaks
The speaker speaks but the truth still leaks

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul

The podium rocks in the crowded waves
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before
He played this role
For the hotel queens and the magazines
Test tube genes and slot machines

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul

Hospitals have made him cry
But there's always a freeway in his eye
Though his beach just got too crowded for a stroll
Roads stretch out like healthy veins
And wild gift horses strain the reins

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal La la la la la la la la la
Ooh

It's going to take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's going to take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far

So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I

It's going to take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's going to take a lotta love
To make things work out right

So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
'cause my head needs relating
Not solitude

Gotta lotta love 
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh
Ooh

It's going to take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's going to take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

Some are bound for happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?


I was down in Dixie Land
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle
See the sky about to rain Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine

I want to see what's never been seen
I want to live that age old dream
Come on, lass, we can go together
Let's take the best right now
Take the best right now

I wanna go to an old hoedown
Long ago in a western town
Pick me up but my feet are dragging
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon

Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine, mine, mine

Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose When your summer days come tumbling down
And you find yourself alone
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and i'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you

Yes i'd miss you
But i never want to hold you down
You might say i'm here for you

When the winter comes to your new home
And snowflakes are falling down
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and i'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you


In the spring, protective arms surrounding you
In the fall, we let you go your way
Happiness i know will always find you
And when it does, i hope that it will stay I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters
I'm having my doubts
I'm watching the skaters
Fly by on the lake
Ice frozen six feet deep
How long does it take?
I look out on peaceful lands
With no war nearby
An ocean of shaking hands
That grab at the sky
I'm singing this borrowed tune
I took from the Rolling Stones
Alone in this empty room
Too wasted to write my own
I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters Hey, hey
Cripple Creek ferry
Butting through
The overhanging trees
Make way
For the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down
It's a mighty tight squeeze

All alone the captain stands
Hasn't heard
From his deck hands
The gambler tips his hat
And walks towards the door
It's the second half
Of the cruise
And you know he hates to lose

Hey, hey
Cripple Creek ferry
Butting through
The overhanging trees
Make way
For the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down
It's a mighty tight squeeze I'm a dreaming man
Yes, that's my problem
I can't tell
When I'm not being real
In the meadow dusk
I park my Aerostar
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you

I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

I see your curves and
I feel your vibrations
You dressed in black and white you lost in the mall
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations
Another sleepless night a sun that won't fall

I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

Now the night is gone a new day is dawning
And our homeless dreams go back to the street
Another time or place another civilization
Would really make this life feel so complete

I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

Dreaming man
He's got a problem
Dreaming man
Dreaming man
He's got a problem
Dreaming man Now that you found yourself
Losing your mind
Are you here again?
Finding that what you once
Thought was real
Is gone, and changing?

Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think
I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
I believe in you
I believe in you

Coming to you at night
I see my questions
I feel my doubts
Wishing that maybe
In a year or two
We could laugh
And let it all out

Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think
I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
I believe in you
I believe in you Darlin', the door is open
To my heart and I've been hopin'
That you won't be the one
To struggle with the key
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
The waitin' time is over
No man sees around the corner
Walkin' in the rain and comin' home dry
There's something missin' there
It's easier to care and try
And I try to wash my hands (Ooh, ooh)
And I try to make amends (Ooh, ooh)
And I try to count my friends (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
I'd like to take a chance
But shit, Mary, I can't dance
So here's to lookin' up your old address
Golly what a mess
We gotta take the rest and try
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
(Ooh, ooh) There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard

Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue?
See what it brings
Could be good things
In the air for you

We are leaving. We are gone
Come with us to all alone
Never worry. Never moan
We will leave you all alone

In the mountains, in the cities
You can see the dream
Look around you. Has it found you?
Is it what it seems?

There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a
Chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

I can love, I can really love, I can really love
I can love, I can really love, I can really love
Like a mountain that's growing, a river that rolls
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love Slipping and sliding
And playing domino
Lefting and then Righting
It's not a crime you know
You got to tell your story boy
Before it's time to go

Are you ready for the country because it's time to go? 

I was talking to the preacher
Said God was on my side
Then I ran into the hangman
He said it's time to die
You gotta tell your story boy
You know the reason why The little creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again

Ears ringing from the battle fire
The tired warrior aims a little higher
The black falcon or the little sparrow
The healing light or the flash of the barrel

No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

Silver mane flying in the wind
Down through the planets on the run again
No one knows where they're running to
But every kind is coming two by two
Out on the delta
Where the hoofbeats pound
The daddy's running on the frozen ground
Can't smell the poison as it follows him
Can't see the gas and machines, it's a war of man

No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

The windows open and the little girl dreams
The sky's her playground as she mounts her steed
Across the heavens to the other side
On wings of magic does the little girl ride

The baby creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again

No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man In the morning when i wake up and listen to the sound
Of the birds outside on the roof
I try to ignore what the paper says
And i try not to read all the news
And i'll hold you if you had a bad dream
And i hope it never comes true
Because you and i been through so many things together
And the sun starts climbing the roof

It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory without anywhere to stay

The red river stills flows through my home town
Rollin' and tumblin' on its way
Swirling around the old bridge pylons
Where a boy fishes the morning away
His bicycle leans on an oak tree
While the cars rumble over his head
An aeroplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky
And the young birds call out to be fed


An old man walks along on the sidewalk
Sunglasses and an old stetson hat
The four winds blow the back of his overcoat away
As he stops with the policeman to chat
And a train rolls out of the station
That was really something in its day
Picking up speed on the straight prairie rails
As it carries the passengers away


It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line

I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothin' on those feelings that I had
'Cause somethin's so hard to find
A situation that can casualize your mind

I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had

Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line Well, they say that Santa Fe
Is less than ninety miles away
And I got time to roll a number and rent a car

Oh, Albuquerque

I've been flying down the road
And I've been starving to be alone
And independent from the scene that I've known

Albuquerque


So I'll stop when I can
Find some fried eggs and country ham
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am

Oh, Albuquerque
Albuquerque I'm going to give you till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm only waiting till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes

I'm going to give you till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm only waiting till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
Your daddy's leaving home today
I think he's gone to stay
We packed up all our bags
And drove out to Winnipeg
When we got to Winnipeg
I checked in to school
I wore white bucks on my feet
When I learned the golden rule
The punches came fast and hard
Lying on my back in the school yard

Don't be denied, don't be denied 

Well pretty soon I met a friend
He played guitar
We used to sit on the steps at school
And dream of being stars
We started a band
We played all night


Oh Canada
We played all night
I really hate to leave you now
But to stay just wouldn't be right
Down in Hollywood
We played so good
The businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There we were on the Sunset Strip
Playing our songs for the highest bid
We played all night
The price was right


Well, all that glitters isn't gold
I know you've heard that story told
And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise
A millionaire through a business man's eyes
Oh friend of mine
Don't be denied I went to the movie
The other night
The plot was groovy
It was out of sight
I sat with my popcorn
Out looking for good times
Lost in the cartoon
I grabbed the lifeline

I've been a searcher
I've been a fool
But I've been a long time coming to you
I'm hoping for your love to carry me through
You're holding my baby and I'm holding you
And it's all right

Oh, tell me where the answer lies
Is it in the notebook
Behind your eyes?
When your decision
Comes to view
I'll be watching my TV
And it'll be watching you

I've been a searcher
I've been a fool
But I've been a long time coming to you
I'm hoping for your love to carry me through
You're holding my baby and I'm holding you
Yes I am
Speaking out I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind
I come down from the crooked mansion
I went looking
For the D.J.'s daughter
Since that day I heard it mentioned
That my name is on the line
Now, my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind
Now, my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind Oh hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught
That my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace
Of my face could seem so pleasing?
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, ""You're strange, but don't change""
And I let her

In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick
Does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face
Is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange I should change?
I don't
Is it strange I should change?
I don't When I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just pass on through
You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again
But I didn't have the cash
I didn't have the cash
Then I tried amphetamines
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my 48 Buick's dash
But I knew that wouldn't last
Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter
But the neon lights
And the endless nights
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes
Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen
Living in the country
Looked good to me
Smoking grass while the summer passed
In a real organic scene
Where everything was green
Then we had a kid and we split apart
I was living on the road
And a little cocaine went a long, long way
To ease that different load
And my head did explode
My head did explode
I thought I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru
Now many years have come and gone
Like friends and enemies
I tried to leave my past behind
But it's catching up with me
It's catching up with me
I don't know how I'm standing here
Living my life
I'm thankful for my children
And my faithful wife Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past, find someone new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past, find someone new
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown

Walk on, talk on, baby tell no lies
Don't you be caught with a tear in your eye
Sure enough they'll be selling stuff
When the moon begins to rise
Pretty bad when you're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes

Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown

Snake eyes, French fries and I got lots of gas
Full moon and a jumping tune, now you don't have to ask
Sure enough, they'll be selling stuff
When the moon begins to rise
Pretty bad when you're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes

Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown

Walk on, talk on, baby tell no lies
Don't you be caught with a tear in your eye
Sure enough they'll be selling stuff
When the moon begins to rise
Pretty bad when you're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes

Pretty bad when
You're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes A lonely man I made myself to be
It's not as bad as some things I have seen
The picture painted here is not a dream
It's only reality the way it seems

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

I'm riding down this wet road in my old car
The moon is almost full except for star shine
The party ended long before the night
But she made me feel alive and that's all right

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you

It’s not that we got anything new
It’s not that it’s any better or worse
The way life treats us is a blessing and a curse
I’m glad I found you

When you’re walking in a crowded place
I’ll try to hide you and give you space
And I’ll protect you from the things that come
I’m glad I found you

The other day when you took my hand
We walked away to the promised land
When I feel your soul in mine
I’m glad I found you

Glad I found you in this sad world
Where so many things have gone wrong
It took me so long just to find you
Right where we belong
I’m glad I found you in this mad world
You’re a lifeline to me
And when I hold you I will shield you
From the things that we both see

So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

God gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there


I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
When you bring it round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down

I'm running 
Down the proud highway
Yeah
I'm runnin 
Down the proud highway
And as long as I keep moving
I won't need a place to stay


Well I'm here to deliver
I hope you can read my mail
I just escaped last night
From the memory county jail
I see your box is open
And you flag is up
My message is ready
If there's time enough

Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down
I always get in trouble
When you bring it round
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down When I woke up you were gone
And the sun was on the lawn
Empty pillow with perfume on
I smelled it
Well we met in my favorite bar
Took a ride in my old car
But I still don't know how
We made it home

Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you

We had drugs and we had booze
But we still had somethin' to lose
And by dawn I wanted to marry you
With our attitudes by day
And our secret dreams by night
Can we really live our lives that way?

Am I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you
Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone for you Remember the Alamo
When help was on the way
It's better here and now
I feel that good today
I'd like to take a walk
But not around the block
I really got some news
I met a man from Mars
He picked up all my guitars
And played me travelling songs
And when we got on ship
He brought out
Something for the trip
And said, It's old but it's good
Like any other primitive would
I'm going to ride my llama
From Peru to Texarkana
I want to ride him good
In my old neighbourhood
I'm going to ride him good
In my old neighbourhood
He brought out
Something for the trip
And said, It's old but it's good
Like any other primitive would There's a lot to learn
For wasting time
There's a heart that burns
There's an open mind

Look out for my love 
You own it, you own it now, you own it

There's a weight on you
But you can't feel it
Living like I do
It's hard for you to see it
Was I hurt too bad
Can I show you daylight
How could I be sad
When I know that you might

Look out for my love 

Look out for my love
It's in your neighborhood
I know things are gonna change
But I can't say bad or good
Silver wings of morning
Shining in the gray day
While the ice is forming
On a lonely runway
Hydraulic wipers pumping
Until the window glistens
Something saying something
No one seems to listen
Men with walkie-talkies
Men with flashlights waving
Up upon the tower
Time reads daylight savings
I'm home again to you babe
You know it makes me wonder
Sitting in the quiet slipstream
In the thunder

Look out for my love  I could live inside a tepee
I could die In Penthouse thirty-five
You could lose me on the freeway
But I would still make it back alive

As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away

See the losers in the best bars
Meet the winners in the dives
Where the people are the real stars
All the rest of their lives

As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away

There's a road
Stretched out between us
Like a ribbon on the high plain
Down from Phoenix through Salinas
Around the bend and back again

As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away Two out of work models and a fashion slave
Try to dance away the Michelob night
The bartender poured herself another drink
While two drunks were watching the fight
The champ went down and he got up again
Then he went out like a light
Fighting for the people
But his timing wasn't right
The high rolling people
Taking limos in the neon light
The Las Vegas people
They came to see a Las Vegas fight
Fighting for the people
There's a man in the window with a big cigar
Says everything's for sale
He had a house and a boat and a railroad car
The owner's got to go to jail
He acquired these things from a life of crime
Now he's selling them to make bail
He was ripping off the people
Selling guns to the underground
Living off the people
Skimming the top when there was no one around
Trying to help the people
Lose their ass for a piece of ground
A patch of ground people
He was dealing antiques in a hardware store
But he sure had a lot to hide
He had a back room full of the guns of war
And a ton ammunition besides
Yeah, he walked with a cane
Kept a bolt on the door with five pit bulls inside
Just a warning to the people
In case they might try to break in at night
Protection from the people
He's selling safety in the darkest night
Trying to help the people
Get the drugs to the street all right
Trying to help the people
Well, it's hard to say where a man goes wrong
Might be here and it might be there
What starts out weak might get too strong
If you can't tell foul from fair
But it's hard to judge from an angry throng
Of hands stretched up in the air
Vigilante people
Taking the law into their own hands
The conscientious people
Cracking down on the drug lord and his bands
Government people
Confiscating all the dealer's land
The patch of ground people
A new Rolls Royce, a company car
They were racing down the street
Each one was trying to make it to the gate
Before employees manned the fleet
The trucks full of products for the modern home
Were set to roll out into the street
Of ordinary people
Trying to make their way to work
The downtown people
Some are saints and some are jerks (that's me!)
That's me, everyday people
Stopping for a drink on their way to work
Alcoholic people
Yeah, yeah
Taking it one day at a time
Down on the assembly line
They keep putting the same things out
The people today, they just ain't buying
Nobody can figure it out
They try like hell to build a quality in
They're working hard without a doubt
Ordinary people
But the dollar's what it's all about
Lee Iaccoca people
But the customers are walking out
The nose to the stone people
Yeah, they look but they just don't buy
The patch of ground people
In a dusty town the clock struck high noon
Two men stood face to face
One wore black and one wore white
But of fear there wasn't a trace
A hundred and eighty years later
Two hot rods drag through the very same place
A half million people
They moved in to pick up the pace
A factory full of people
Making parts to go to outer space
A train load of people
They were leaving for another place
Out of town people
Down at the factory they're putting new windows in
The vandals made a mess of things
And the homeless just walked right in
Well, they worked here once and they live here now
But they might work here again
The ordinary people
They're just living in a dream
Hard working people
Just don't know what it means
To give up people
They're just like they used to be
Patch of ground people
Out on the railroad track they're cleaning old number nine
They're scrubbing the boiler down
She really is looking fine (a beauty, that number nine!)
Times'll be different soon they're going to bring her back on line
Ordinary people
They're going to bring the good things back
Hard working people
They put the business back on track
The everyday people
I got faith in the regular kind
Patch of ground people There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes

Leave us
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

Well babe, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across my doors
Baby, baby sing with me somehow

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes

Leave us
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

Helpless, helpless, help-helpless A hip drag queen and a side-walking street wheeler
Comin' down the avenue
They're all your friends, you'll come to love 'em
There's a load of 'em waiting for you

Lookout Joe, you're coming home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times

Remember Millie from down in Philly?
She took my brain and forgot my name
The woman you were with was about the same
She took your money and left town

Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
(Take it, Ben!)

Glory Hallelujah!
Will I lay my burden down?
Singing on the streets around
Look at that crazy clown!
(Look at!)

Remember Bill from up on the hill?
A Cadillac put a hole in his arm
But old Bill, he's up there still
Havin' a ball rolling to the bottom

Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
Old times were good times Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message around her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
And when she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep


There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right I won't apologize
The light shone from in your eyes
It isn't gone
And it will soon come back again

Now we go our separate ways
Lookin' for better days
Sharin' our little boy
Who grew from joy back then

And it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Yes, it do, yes, it do
Oh
Well, it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Separate ways

Me for me, you for you
Happiness is never through
It's only a change of ways
And that is nothing new

I'm feelin' better now
I live more alive somehow
My eyes are opened
And my heart is pourin' through

And it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Yes, it do, yes, it do
Oh yes, it do
It's all because of that love for you, babe
Made the world go separate ways
Separate ways
Means that we'll go separate ways Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone?
All you have is memories of happiness lingering on
All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you
They're only passing through you in the end
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to
And wait for you to come back again
Yet still a light is shining from that lamp on down the hall
Maybe the star of Bethlehem wasn't a star at all Well, I used to drive a cab you know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky
The preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool
He said ""With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?""

Well, I used to be a woman you know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
'Cause you're the kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like to be so far over my head
Well, the lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees and said
""Let's get on with this thing""

Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes

Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said

Well, I was driving down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station but I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green
Although I knew I could not
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know

I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, ""No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years""
I said, ""No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years""
He said, ""Go get lost!"" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his back It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the morning sun is yet
To climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out, mama
Because I'm coming home tonight

Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on the sound
Of some open-hearted people going down

I'm not going back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to hear that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe
I'll be going back that way

Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on the sound
Of some open-hearted people going down I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could it be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now


I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now I came to you when I needed a rest
You took my love and put it to the test
I saw some things that I never would have guessed
Well I've been down but I'm comin' back up again
And I'm rolling down the open road
Where my true love, she lies waiting
Right now I'm thinking 'bout these things I know
But the daylight will soon be breaking

You were my raft and I let you slide
It seemed like such a long easy ride
I was adrift on a river of pride
Feels like a railroad, I pull a whole load behind me
That ol' white line is a friend of mine
And its good time that we've been making
Right now I'm thinking 'bout those things that I know
But the daylight will soon be breakin'
Breakin' I went into town to see you yesterday
But you were not home
So I talked to some old friends for a while
Before I wandered off alone

It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losin' end
And I feel that way again

Well, I miss you more than ever
Since you've gone I can hardly maintain
Things are different round here
Every night my tears fall down like rain

It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losin' end
And I feel that way again
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losin' end
And I feel that way again You know I lose, you know I win
You know I call for the shape I'm in
It's just a game you see me play
Only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
Although the answer is not unknown
I'm searching, searching and how I've grown
It's not all right to say goodbye
And the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
It's only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing Up in the rainbow, teepee sky
No one's looking down on you or I
That's just a mirror in your eye
Ain't taken my last hit yet
I know that things are different now
(I see the same old signs
But something new is growing)
Don't think I'll cash it in yet
Don't think I'll put down my last bet
(I'm gonna keep my hand in
Because something new is growing)

Think I'll hit the Peace Trail
Take a trip back home to my old town
'Cause everyone back there says
Something new is growing

Up in the rainbow, teepee sky
No one's looking down on you or I
It's just a mirror in our eye
If I believe in someone
I have to believe in myself
(I have to take good care
When something new is growing)
The world is full of changes
Sometimes all these changes make me sad
(But I keep planting seeds
Till something new is growing)

I think I'll hit the Peace Trail
I know that treasure takes its time
(I have to take good care
When something new is growing)
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail
I think I like my chances now
(I have to take good care
When something new is growing)
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail
I think I'll hit the Peace Trail now
Because something new is growing It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the mornin' sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out mama 'cause I'm comin' home tonight

Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on the sound
Of some open hearted people goin' down

I'm not goin' back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to hear that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No I don't believe I'll be goin' back that way

Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish who swam upstream
Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears
When the water grew less deep
My fins were aching from the strain
I'm swimming in my sleep
I know I can't go back again
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
I'll never lose it
Never lose the will to love
Never lose the will
It's like something from up above
I can be like a fire in the night
Always warm and giving off light
But there comes a time when I shine too bright
Oh, I'm just a fire in the night
And now my fins are in the air
And my belly is scraping on the rocks
I still think someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming 'til I stop
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
It's like something from up above
Never lose the will to love
Never lose the will
I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea
Cool running love keeps cleansing me
It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care
But I'll never lose
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
Never lose the will to love
It's like something from up above
Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself 'til all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again
I remember the ocean from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger and I can't, won't be tamed
But I'll never lose the will to love
Never lose the will to love
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
It's like something from up above
I'm not gonna lose the will to love
Baby, if I see boredom in your eyes
I'll know my river has run dry
But I won't turn back with that lonely tide
I bought that ticket and I'll take that ride
If we meet along the way, please sway beside me
Let us sway together, our tails together
And our fins and mind will leave this water
And let our scales shine
In the sun above and the sky below
So all the water and earth will know
It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there Transformer man, transformer man
You run the show remote control
Direct the action with the push of a button
You're a transformer man
Power in your hand
Transformer man, transformer man

Transformer man, transformer man
Sooner or later you'll have to see
The cause and effect
So many things still left to do
But we haven't made it yet
Every morning
When I look in your eyes
I feel electrified by you. Oh yes

Transformer man, transformer man
Transformer man, still in command
You're eyes are shining on a beam
Through the galaxy of love
Transformer man, transformer man
Unlock the secrets
Let us throw off the chains that
Hold you down


Transformer man, transformer man  Now that the holidays have come
They can relax and watch the sun
Rise above all of the beautiful things they've done
Go to the country take the dog
Look at the sky without the smog
See the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogs
Eat hot dogs
What a pity
That the people from the city
Can't relate to the slower things
That the country brings

Time itself is bought and sold
The spreading fear of growing old
Contains a thousand foolish games that we play
While people planning trips to stars
Allow another boulevard
To claim a quiet country lane
It's insane

So the subtle face is a loser this time around
Here we are in the years
Where the showman shifts the gears
Lives become careers
Children cry in fear
Let us out of here I waited for you, Winterlong
You seem to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway

If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy on that day

Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now

Half the time has passed away (Sha-la-la-la)
Things we thought of yesterday (Sha-la-la-la)
Come back now, come back now, wow-ow

Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now

Half the time has passed away (Sha-la-la-la)
Things we thought of yesterday (Sha-la-la-la)
Come back now, come back now, wow-ow

I waited for you Winterlong
You seem to be where I belong In a matter of time
There'll be a friend of mine
Going to come to the coast
You're going to see him
Up close for a minute or two
While the ground cracks under you
By the look in your eyes
You'd think that it was a surprise
But you seem to forget
Something somebody said
About the bubbles in the sea
And an ocean full of trees

And you now, L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too? 

Well, it's hard to believe
So you get up to leave
And you laugh at the door
That you heard it all before
Oh it's so good to know
That it's all just a show for you
But when the suppers are planned
And the freeways are crammed
And the mountains erupt
And the valley is sucked
Into cracks in the earth
Will I finally be heard by you

L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too?  There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
But there's a warning sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin'  in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world We don't snort it, we don't lick it
We don't knock it, we don't kick it
We don't smoke it no more
We don't smoke it no more
We don't smoke it no more
We don't smoke it no more
We don't smoke it no more Fourteen junkies
Too weak to work
One sells diamonds
For what they're worth
Down on pain street
Disappointment lurks

Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait
Until the break of day
Because you know
How time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

All day presidents
Look out windows
All night sentries
Watch the moon glow
All are waiting until
The time is right


Back in Canada
I spent my days
Riding subways
Through a haze
I was handcuffed
I was born & raised


Thirteen junkies
Too weak to work
One sells diamonds
For what they're worth
Down on pain street
Disappointment lurks


Time fades away
You know how time fades away I know I said I love you
I know you know it's true
I've got to put the phone down
And do what we got to do
One's standing in the aisleway
Two more at the door
We've got to get inside there
Before they kill
Time is running out, let's roll
No time for indecision
We've got to make a move
I hope that we're forgiven
For what we got to
How this all got started
I'll never understand
I hope someone can fly this thing
And get us back to land
Time is running out, let's roll
No one has the answer
But one thing is true
You've got to turn on evil
When it's coming after you
You've got to face it down
And when it tries to hide
You've got to go in after it
And never be denied
Time is running out, let's roll
Let's roll for freedom
Let's roll for love
We're going after Satan
On the wings of a dove
Let's roll for justice
Let's roll for truth
Let's not let our children
Grow up fearful in their youth
Time is running out, let's roll I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good

My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy
He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea
Exploded on the water for everyone to see
And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy

I saw him in Nassau in 1971
His strength was failing but he still ran a run
He worked till his fingers wore to the bone
To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own

He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron
That steel hull freighter was passing its time
And time flew by faster with life on the sea
And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy

I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good All her friends call her Little Wing
But she flies rings around them all
She comes to town when the children sing
And leaves them feathers if they fall
She leaves them feathers if they fall

Little Wing, don't fly away
When the summer turns to fall
Don't you know some people say
The winter is the best time of them all?
Winter is the best of all Woke up this morning with love in mind
It was raining outside but my love still shined
Kept me warm Until my plane touched the sky

And I've seen love
Make a fool of a man
He tried to make a loser win
But I've got nothing to lose
I can't get back again
Man made rules
Been holdin' back my love
Can't hold it back no more
Churches long preach sex is wrong
Jesus where is nature gone?
What am I doing here?  Let's impeach the President for lying
And misleading our country into war
Abusing all the power that we gave him
And shipping all our money out the door
He's the man who hired all the criminals
The White House shadows who hide behind closed doors
They bend the facts to fit with their new stories
Of why we have to send our men to war
Let's impeach the President for spying
On citizens inside their own homes
Breaking every law in the country
By tapping our computers and telephones
What if Al Qaeda blew up the levees
Would New Orleans have been safer that way
Sheltered by our government's protection
Or was someone just not home that day?
Flip - Flop
Flip - Flop
Flip - Flop
Flip - Flop
Let's impeach the president for hijacking
Our religion and using it to get elected
Dividing our country into colors
And still leaving black people neglected
Thank God he's cracking down on steroids
Since he sold his old baseball team
There's lots of people looking at big trouble
But of course our president is clean
Thank God Who are you? Where are you goin' to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showin' through?
I look in your eyes and I don't know what's there
You poison me with that long, vacant stare
You dress like her and she walks in your words
You frown at me and then you smile at her

Are you my friend? Are you my enemy?
Can we pretend to live in harmony?
You come through in the weirdest way
You copy her with the words that you say
I need that girl like the night needs the day
I don't need you getting in my way


Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy

Who are you? Where are you goin' to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showin' through? Let's go to Florida
Palm trees and shit, man (Okay, here we go)
Palm trees and humid weather

It was like a town in Florida in the, in the fifties, you know?
I don't know, there was a lot of white buildings and
They were really white, I could see them
They were about seven or eight stories tall
All the, all the people were walking around and
Just looked so good, you know
They all had their, uh, blue dresses and nice pants on
You know, and they're, all of 'em are drinking pop
From, you know, with straws in the bottles
Things were lookin', you know, sun was shinin' so bright
The downtown looked incredible, I couldn't believe it
There were gliders flyin' around in the sky
This guy is flying around in gliders, you know, and they
They'd swoop between the buildings and they
They'd go down the alleyways, you know
And they make a sharp left and a sharp right
And, uh, it's like I—
I couldn't believe that it was really happening, you know?
So I said, you know, ""I don't believe this, this isn't real""
And just as I said that, this guy in the glider
Was coming right through the center of town
And he ran into the building in the middle of town
Fifteen-story high building, right in the center of town
He started tumbling through the air, you know, and, uh
His glider crashed in the alley and, uh
I noticed this couple on the, uh, on the parking lot
And, uh, they, they were just walking together in conversation, you know?
Like, uh, nothing else was happening
And, uh, looking up, they noticed the tumbling man coming through the air
And, uh, he, he came right down and landed right on them
And made an awful sound and, uh—
I ran over there, I could see that they were
They were really gone, you know
But on the ground beside them was this little baby, uh, dressed in
It just had a red blanket wrapped around it
So I picked it up and took it to my car
You know, over on the corner, which wasn't too far away
And I put it in the back seat
I don't know whether it was a boy or a girl
I, I didn't look, you know, I just put it down
It was sleeping and I looked and a crowd had gathered on the parking lot
This beautiful lady was coming down the street
And I, I looked at her, and she looked right at me and I—
She said, ""That's my baby in the back of your car there""
I said, ""Oh, no, no
No, that baby belongs to that, to that dead couple on the parking lot""
And, uh, she said, ""No, no, you're wrong, you're wrong
What happened to them?"" New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm living in a dreamland

Changing times, ancient reasons
That turn to lies
Throw them all away
Head in hand, gift of wonders to understand
And open all the way

New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm living in a dreamland (Come on in here)

At first I didn't like him
He came asking for a loan
I got nervous when he came into view

On and overdose of vitamins
Trying to explain
Something that I already knew

He said help me stay afloat and get back to
Hawaii
Hawaii

All the paintings and the sketches
Lay scattered on the sand
And the condominium was close at hand

Things were getting hard to follow
I was feeling pretty hollow
When the stranger came to me and put out his hand

He said I think we better talk there's something you don't understand
About Hawaii
Hawaii

With my baby and my bicycle
I up and rode away
And many nights have passed since this morning came my way

And I think about him often
With his vitamins and kids
Does he sleep with half a women on his mind?

Well the other half just got left behind
In Hawaii
Hawaii In a foreign land
There were creatures at play
Running hand in hand
Needing no where to stay
Driven to the mountains high
They were sunken in the cities deep
Living in my sleep
I feel like going back
Back where there's nowhere to stay
When fire filled the sky
I'll still remember that day
These rocks I'm climbing down
Have already left the ground
Careening through space
I used to build these buildings
I used to walk next to you
Their shadows tore us apart
And now we do what we do
Driven to the mountains high
Sunken in the cities deep
Living in our sleep
I feel like going back
Back where there's nowhere to stay Cars and trucks
Fly by me on the corner
But I'm all right
Standing proud before the signal
When I see the light
I know I'm more
Than just a number
And I stand before you
Or else we just don't see the other
Computer age computer age
Computer age
Bikes and vans
Fly by me on the desert
But I'm all right
Standing out here in the hot sun
When I see the light
I feel like more than just a number
And I stand before you
Or else we just don't see the other
Computer age computer age
Computer age
Precious metal lines
Molded into highways
Running through me
So microscopically
Days and nights
Weeks and months and seasons
Rolling through me
So chronologically
Computer age computer age
Computer age
I need you
To let me know that there's a heartbeat
Let it pound and pound
And I'll be flying like a free bird
And you need me
Like ugly needs a mirror
And day by day
This horizon's getting clearer
Computer age computer age
Computer age Oh, the feeling's gone
Why is it so hard
To hang on to your love?
Oh, the things we do
To live beyond the fears
And move on through the years
Think I'll go to Mexico
Gonna take my time and go down slow
Making love in Mexico
Think I'll go to Mexico
Oh, those sandy beaches
Daddy is a travelin' man Was he thinking about my country
Or the color of my skin?
Was he thinking about my religion
And the way i worshiped him?
Did he create just me in his image
Or every living thing?

When god made me 

Was he planning only for believers
Or for those who just have faith?
Did he envision all the wars
That were fought in his name?
Did he say there was only one way
To be close to him?


Did he give me the gift of love
To say who we could choose?


Did he give me the gift of voice
So some could silence me?
Did he give me the gift of vision
Not knowing what i might see?
Did he give me the gift of compassion
To help my fellow man? Well, the cop made the showdown
He was sure he was right
He had all of the lowdown
From the bank heist last night
His best friend was the robber
And his wife was a thief
All the children were killers
They couldn't get no relief
The bungalow was surrounded
When a voice loud and clear
Said, ""Come on out with your hands up""
Or we'll blow you out of here
There was a face in the window
The TV cameras rolled
Then they cut to the announcer
And the story was told

The artist looked at the producer
The producer sat back
He said, ""What we have got here, is a perfect track""
But we don't have a vocal
And we don't have a song
If we could get these things accomplished
Nothing else could go wrong
So he balanced the ashtray
As he picked up the phone
And said, ""Send me a songwriter,""
""who's drifted far from home""
And make sure that he's hungry
Make sure he's alone
Send me a cheeseburger
And a new Rolling Stone
Yeah

There's still crime in the city
Said the cop on the beat
I don't know if I can stop it
I feel like meat on the street
They paint my car like a target
I take my orders from fools
Meanwhile some kid
Blows my head off
Well, I play by their rules
That's why I'm doing it my way
I took the law in my hands
So here I am in the alleyway
A wad of cash in my pants
I get paid by a ten year old
He says he looks up to me
There's still crime in the city
But it's good to be free
Yeah

Now I come from a family
That has a broken home
Sometimes I talk to Daddy
On the telephone
When he says that he loves me
I know that he does
But I wish I could see him
I wish I knew where he was
But that's the way
All my friends are
Except maybe one or two
Wish I could see him this weekend
Wish I could walk in his shoes
But now I'm doing my own thing
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
Although my home has been broken
It's the best home I ever had
Yeah

Well, I keep getting younger
My life's been funny that way
Before I ever learned to talk
I forgot what to say
I sassed back to my mom
I sassed back to my teacher
I got thrown out of Bible school
For sassing back at the preacher
Then I grew up to be a fireman
Put out every fire in town
Put out anything smoking
But when I put the hose down
The judge sent me to prison
He gave me life without parole
Wish I never put the hose down
Wish I never got old My life's an open book
You read it on the radio
We got nowhere to hide
We got nowhere to go
But if you still decide
That you want to take a ride
 
Meet me at the wrecking ball
Wrecking ball
Wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight

I see your smoky eyes
Right across the bar
I've seen that look before
Shining from star to star
Though I can't take that chance
If you got time for one dance
 

The restless line of cars
Goes stretching down the road
But I won't telephone
Because you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way?
What is it makes me want to say
  On the lake, the deep forbidden lake
The old boats go gliding by
And the leaves are falling from the trees
And landing on the logs and I
See the turtles heading for the bog
And falling off the log
They make the water splash and feeling no backlash
They climb the happy banks
On the boats, the old and creaky boats
The shoreline goes gliding by
And the wind that was a dying breeze
Is making the banners fly
See the colors floating on the sky
The pride of the captain's eye
As he glides his slender craft inside
And opens up the door
On the coast, the long and tempting coast
The cards on the table lie
And a speech so eloquent in reach
Was made by a passerby
Passing by the way between here and left behind
And it ripples through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake
Yes, it echoes through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake Someone's hanging out
We can't forget about
Things that people do
When they're free
Like visitors from space
It's hard to find a place
To blend in and go unrecognized
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm standing on the road
My mind outstretched to you
I'm picking something up
I'm letting something go
Like a dog I'm fetching
This to you
Pictures in mind
Rows of poppy fields
Harmony entwined
Changing gear that grinds
Pictures in my mind
Pictures in my brain
Electrical energy
Fighting drugs with pain
There's a war inside
Pictures in my brain
I'm looking for a job
I don't know what I'm doing
My software's
Not compatible with you
But this I can't deny
I know that you can fly
Cause I'm here
On the ground without you
Angel without wings
Owner without things
Sharpshooter without rings
Around you
The road we used to ride
Together side by side
Has flowers pushing
Through the dotted line Do you see people being led, by the righteous hands?
Taking care of everyone like they run a piece of land;
Show me
Show me
Show me
Show me
Do you see people's lives being lost on the sacred land?
In the battle over water being fought, for the baby's hand;
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
When the women of the world are free to stand up for themselves
And the promises made, stop gathering dust on the shelf;
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Well, I hear ya out there when you say what you have to say
I know how you feel, cause that's what made me this way
When heaven on Earth is improved by the hand of man
And people everywhere get together and join their hands;
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
Show Me
(Harmonica solo)
Show Me
Show Me I am dreaming Dear of you, day by day
Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray;
When the silv'ry moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams
In a land of love, it seems, Just with you
Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you
Longing for you all the while, More and more;
Longing for the sunny smile, I adore;
Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere
You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you
Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you When I sing about love and war
I don't really know what I'm saying
I've been in love and I've seen a lot of war
Seen a lot of people praying
They pray to Allah and they prey to the lord
But mostly they pray about love and war
Pray about love and war
I've seen a lot of young men go to war
And leave a lot of young brides waiting
I've watched them try to explain it to their kids
And seen a lot of them failing
They tried to tell them and they tried to explain
Why Daddy won't ever come home again
Daddy won't ever come home again
I said a lot of things that I can't take back
But I don't really know if I want to
There've been songs about love
I sang songs about war
Since the backstreets of Toronto
I sang for justice and I hit a bad chord
But I still try to sing about love and war
Sing about love and war
The saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to break the heart of your lover
I made a mistake and I did it again
And we struggled to recover
Then I sang in anger, hit another bad chord
But I still try to sing about love and war
I've been in love and I've seen a lot of war
Seen a lot of people praying
They pray to Allah and they prey to the lord
But mostly they pray about love and war
Pray about love and war What can I do, what can I say
Running down
This suspicious highway
I can't forget how love let me down
And when we meet it still gets in my way

But we're already one
Already one
Now only time can come between us
Because we're already one
Our little son won't let us forget

Your laughing eyes, your crazy smile
Every time I look in his face
I can't believe how love lasts a while
And looks like ""forever"" in the first place


In my new life I'm traveling light
Eyes wide open for the next move
I can't go wrong 'til I get right
But I'm not falling back in the same groove Once I was in love
Now it seems that time
Is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know

So don't say you lose
Don't say you lose
Don't say you win
And no one else will know
No one else will know
When you're down
You gather strength
To leave the ground
And when you're high
It makes you weak
And you fall back down

Once I was in love
Now it seems that time
Is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know Wake up! It's a Monday morning
No time left to say goodbye
Can't breathe
And the lights are changing

You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughing
Oh no, oh no

Headlights
Make it home by sundown
Feeling that the day is through
Return back to where you come from


You wake up in the morning
And the sun's coming up
Its been up for hours
And hours and hours
And hours and hours and hours
It's been up for hours
And hours and hours
And you light up the stove
And the coffee cup, its hot
And the orange juice
Is cold, cold, cold
Monday morning
Wake up, wake up 
It's time to go
Time to go to work

You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughing
Oh no, oh no
No, no, no Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Where life's a joy
For girls and boys
And only will get better
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Romeo and Juliet
The doctor and his case
Without a plan they left the van
And there were laid to waste
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
The priest was there
With sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

He held her hand
And wished her well
Although his heart was aching
The cameras rolled
The print was bold
The holy war was breaking
It's hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Where life's a joy
For girls and boys
And only will get better
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

The priest was there
With sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied In the crystal ball
The gypsy sees the villa
The riders on the hill
The fire in the fields
She sees the mission bell
Swinging in the silence
Now the shooting starts
The bullets pierce the hearts
The senoritas crying at the well

Up in the Gold Hotel
The money hits the table
The heavies all are there
That's why the deal's going down
Beautiful women all dressed in
Diamonds and sable
Down upon the street
Beside a garbage heap
A Mariachi band begins to play

Somewhere a blues guitar
Plays echoes in the alleyway
The Tijuana dawn
Claims another day
The golden sun
Rises on the runway
The pilot understands
The money changes hands
Inside the jet
The briefcase snaps goodbye

In Eldorado town
There lives a great bullfighter
His eyes are screaming blue
His hair is red as blood
And when the gate goes up
The crowd gets so excited
And he comes dancing out
Dressed in gold lami
He kills the Bull
And lives another day Looking for a leader
To bring our country home
Re-unite the red white and blue
Before it turns to stone
Looking for somebody
Young enough to take it on
Clean up the corruption
And make the country strong
Walking among our people
There's someone who's straight and strong
To lead us from desolation
And a broken world gone wrong
Someone walks among us
And i hope he hears the call
And maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all
Yeah maybe it's Obama
But he thinks that he's too young
Maybe it's Colin Powell
To right what he's done wrong
America has a leader
But he's not in the house
He's waling here among us
And we've got to seek him out
Yeah we've got our election
But corruption has a chance
We got to have a clean win
To regain confidence
America is beautiful
But she has an ugly side
We're looking for a leader
In this country far and wide
We're looking for a leader
With the great spirit on his side
Someone walks among us
And i hope he hears the call
And maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Bruce Berry was a workin' man
He used to load that Econoline Van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hand
Well, late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day is long
Tonight's the night, yes it is, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, yes it is, tonight's the night
Early in the mornin' at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
Cause people let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he died out on the mainline
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Bruce Berry was a workin' man
He used to load that Econoline Van
But early in the mornin', about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night Rommel wore a ring on his finger
He only took it off
When he flew his plane
Once he told me why
He said we all have to fly
Someday
We all have to fly
Someday
The T.V. preacher can't be bothered
(""Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!"")
With those petty things
(""Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!"")
He stays a step removed so they say
(""Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!"")
(""Praise The Lord! Praise and Pay!"")
He's piping music in
We all have to sin
Someday
We all have to sin
Someday
Working on that great Alaska pipeline
Many men were lost in the pipe
They went to fueling cars
Now smog might turn to stars
Someday
Smog might turn to stars
Someday
Hold me baby, put your arms around me
Give me all the love you have to give
Tomorrow won't be late
We won't have to wait
Someday
We won't have to wait
Someday The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
The holy war was slowly building
Heroes leaving for the great crusade
Seek reward in the ever after
Ever after
Ever after
Don't wanna have to lose you baby
Don't want to have to take you back
You know I'll never lose you baby
Abuse you baby
Use you baby
You know I'll always help you baby
But I just can't do that
I know I said I'd help you baby
Here's my wallet
Call me sometime
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love Living on the edge of night
You know the sun won't go down slow
You don't know which drug is right
Can't decide which way you want to go
I feel the way you feel
Because not so long ago
It had a hold on me
I couldn't let it go
It wouldn't set me free
It wouldn't set me free
No more, no more, no more

Seemed like the easy thing
To let it go for one more day
Like singing the same old song
And twisting the words
In a different way
Where did the magic go
I searched high and low
I can't find it no more
I can't get it back
I can't find it no more
I can't find it no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

Searching for quality
Having to have the very best
Now scrounging for quantity
Never having time
To do the test
That's how the story goes
Can't put it down
Till the last page
I can't put it down
I can't put it down
I can't put it down Working hard every day
Never notice how
The time slips away
People come, seasons go
We got something
That'll never grow old

I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold

I used to have a treasure chest
Got so heavy that I had to rest
I let it slip away from me
Didn't need it anyway
So I let it slip away

I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold
I don't care
If the sun don't shine
And the rain keeps pouring
Down on me and mine
Cause our kind of love
Never seems to get old
It's better than silver and gold You know it takes a long, long time 
You love her so and still you know
That you will never want to let her go
Unless you leave her first
Then you come out on top
But, still there's just one thing
You haven't got

Peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space

You know it takes a long, long time 
When first you gave and shared your soul
Showed her all those things that take their toll
She knows your weak spot
But, she still gets you hot
So you do it again
Reveal what lies within

And go for peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space
You're looking for peace of mind
Anywhere you can find
Still searching for peace of mind

You know it takes a long, long time  Though the river flows
Gently to the sea
He was on the shore
Rooted like a tree
She was here and there
Riding on the waves
Through it all, she heard his call
And gave it all she gave

And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance
And start again
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance

And when the melody
Through the window called
It echoed in the courtyard
And whispered in the halls
He played it through the night
She knew he had to go
There was something about freedom
He thought he didn't know

And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance
And start again
And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance

Though the river flowed
Gently to the sea
He was on the shore
Rooted like a tree
She was here and there
Riding on the waves
Through it all, she heard his call
And gave it all she gave

And though their love
Was hanging on a limb
She taught him how to dance The painter stood
Before her work
She looked around every where
She saw the pictures and she painted them
She picked the colors from the air
Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow
In the light
Black to black
When the evening comes
Blue to blue
In the night

It's a long road
Behind me
It's a long road
Ahead
If you follow every dream
You might get lost
If you follow every dream
You might
Get
Lost

She towed the line
She held her end up
She did the work of too many
But in the end
She fell down
Before she got up again
I keep my friends eternally
We leave our tracks in the sound
Some of them are with me now
Some of them can't be found All of a sudden she was on my mind
I wasn't ready for her kind
And she was taking her time

What if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that  she'd like to do
Anything I would
Or would she leave me?

Lately I've found myself losing my mind
Knowing how badly I need her
It's something hard to find

What if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that  she'd like to do
Anything I would
Or would she leave me?

If I could have her tonight
Does she want to go?
Look at those eyes
Does she want it?
If I could have her tonight
If I could have her tonight
If I could have her tonight Terrorist suicide hang gliders
In the sky above you can't see
Hidden there in the darkness
Behind the reasons that you're free
I got news along the way
That I bring to you with sorrow
I never knew 'till yesterday
My life would end tomorrow
I think I know who to blame
It's all those people with funny names
Moving in to our neighborhood
How can I tell if they're bad or good?
Terrorist suicide hang gliders
In the sky above you can't see
Hidden there in the darkness
Behind the reasons that you're free I've been wrong before
And I'll be there again
I don't have any answers my friend
Just this pile of old questions
My memory left me here
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
I'm going back to my house
But I'm not going now
It's too early
To be leaving here, somehow
Let me bore you with this story
""How my lover let me down""
While I borrow seeds of sadness
From the ground

In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
There ain't no way of telling
Where these seeds will rise or when
I'll just wait around until springtime
And then, I'll find a friend
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again

When I'm all done cultivating
I'll be rocking on the porch
Trying to picture
You and where you are
And there'll be no hesitating
When Cupid lights the torch
With those headlights coming down the hill
Between the stars Don't cry, my sweet girl
Nothing I say is written in stone
Don't cry, my sweet love
You won't really be alone

I'll help you pack your things
I'll walk with you out to the car
I'll hold on to the ring
I won't forget the way things are
My sweet love
Your disappointed eyes
Are haunting me like my big lies
I see you glaring now
I see you staring in the fire
My sweet love

Don't cry, my sweet girl
Nothing I say is written in stone
Don't cry, my sweet love
You won't really be alone

My sweet love, my sweet love

Don't cry, my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Don't cry, my sweet girl
You won't really be alone
Don't cry, my sweet girl
You won't really be alone Sample and Hold

Sample and hold When I hold you in my arms
It's a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there
All those people with their faces
Walking up the street
They don't have to say a thing
Just look around and you see

New buildings going up
Old buildings coming down
New signs going up
Old signs coming down
You got to hold onto something in this life

Well the older generation
They got something to say
But they better say it fast
Or get out of the way
All those gangsters with their crimes
They make it look so good
We've been blowing up the planet
Just like the old neighbourhood


If I only had a heart
It would beat all night for you
If I only had a heart
I would cry the whole day through
When I hold you in my arms
It's like a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there

Old heart's going up
Old heart's coming down
My feelings going up
My feelings coming down
You got to hold onto someone in this life

When I hold you in my arms
It's a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there I feel like I just woke up from a bad dream
And it's so good to have you sleepin' by my side

Although I'm not so sure
If I even know your name
Hold on, baby, hold on
We can go gliding through the air
Far from the tears you've cried

Yes, you're the one I'm talkin' to this mornin'
With your mind so kind and your friendly body lying

In my bungalow of stucco
That the glory and success spawned
Hold on, baby, hold on
It doesn't matter if you're the one
We'll know before we're done Protect the wild
Tomorrow's child
Protect the land
From the greed of man
Take out the dams
Stand up to oil
Protect the plants
And renew the soil

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

End fossil fuel
Draw the line
Before we build
One more pipeline
End fracking now
Let's save the waters
And build a life
For our sons and daughters

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

Damn the dams
Save the rivers
Starve the takers
And feed the givers
Let's build the green
Let's save the world
We're the people
Known as Earth

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me! Take my advice
Don't listen to me
It ain't paradise
But it used to be
There was a time
When the river was wide
And the water came running down
To the rising tide
But the wooden ships
Were just a hippie dream
Just a hippie dream
Don't bat an eye
Don't waste a word
Don't mention nothing
That could go unheard
Because the tie-dye sails
Are the screaming sheets
And the dusty trail
Leads to blood in the streets
And the wooden ships
Are a hippie dream
Capsized in excess
If you know what I mean
Just because it's over for you
Don't mean it's over for me
It's a victory for the heart
Every time the music starts
So please don't kill the machine
Don't kill the machine 
Another flower child
Goes to seed
In an ether-filled
Room of meat-hooks
It's so ugly
So ugly Tumbleweed
Your inner spirit is a peace sign to me
Life is full of little tricks and
We can always pick up sticks and build again
That’s what we do

Harmony
The way we hold on when we tumble through the night
Life is full of strange delights and
In the darkness we find lights to make our way
Back home again

Tumbleweed
I’m baring my soul to you
Tumbleweed
It’s all that I’ve got that’s true

Bite me now
With your confusion, your happiness and delight
It will only hurt a moment
Then it’s gone and you can see there’s nothing left
To leave a mark

Animal
Care for your kind, in the way you always do
When the flower moon is shining
It’s eclipse and your lips smiling comfort me
And I comfort you

Tumbleweed
Your inner spirit is a peace sign to me She's a victim of her senses
Do you know her?
Can you see her in the distance
As she tumbles by?
Veteran of a race that should be over
Can you hear her sigh?
With wings to fly she rolls along
Doing it wrong

Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long

There's a place that I know we could go
Get away for a while
I can bring her the peace that she needs
Give her reason to smile

Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long
Oh, I've loved her so long This old guitar ain't mine to keep
Just taking care of it now
It's been around for years and years
Just waiting in its old case
It's been up and down the country roads
It's brought a tear and a smile
It's seen its share of dreams and hopes
And never went out of style
The more i play it, the better it sounds
It cries when i leave it alone
Silently it waits for me
Or someone else i suppose

This old guitar 

This old guitar has caught some breaks
But it never searched for gold
It can't be blamed for my mistakes
It only does what it's told
It's been a messenger in times of trouble
In times of hope and fear
When i get drunk and seeing double
It jumps behind the wheel and steers

This old guitar ain't mine to keep
It's mine to play for a while
This old guitar ain't mine to keep
It's only mine for a while When the red sun sets
On the railroad town
And the bars begin to laugh
With a happy sound
I'll still be here
Right by your side
There'll not be anyone
In my heart but you

And the dreams that you're having
They won't let you down
If you just follow on
Cause you know
Where you're bound
The well will be flowing
And the words will come fast
When the one who is coming
Arrives here at last

On the grassy hills
Of the railroad town
Where we cut through the fences
And over the crown
Where wind was blowing
Right through your hair
I dreamt that my Momma
And Daddy were there We control the data banks
We control the think tanks
We control the flow of air
We're controlling traffic lights
We control computer flights
We control the chief of staff
We control the TV sky
We control the FBI
We control the flow of heat
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B

We're controlling 
We control
We're controlling
We control 

We control you floor to floor
We control you door to door
We're controlling
While you sleep
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B
Computer age in harm's way
We will prevail
And perform our function
C.C.T.B

We are in control 

Chemical computer
Thinking battery I'm living with war everyday
I'm living with war in my heart everyday
I'm living with war right now

And when the dawn breaks I see my fellow man
And on the flat-screen we kill and we're killed again
And when the night falls, I pray for peace
Try to remember peace (visualize)
I join the multitudes
I raise my hand in peace
I never bow to the laws of the thought police
I take a holy vow
To never kill again
To never kill again

I'm living with war in my heart
I'm living with war in my heart in my mind
I'm living with war right now

Don't take no tidal wave
Don't take no mass grave
Don't take no smoking gun
To show how the west was won
But when the curtain falls, I pray for peace
Try to remember peace
In the crowded streets
In the big hotels
In the mosques and the doors of the old museum
I take a holy vow
To never kill again
Try to remember peace

The rocket's red glare
Bombs bursting in air
Give proof through the night
That our flag is still there

I'm living with war everyday
I'm living with war in my heart everyday
I'm living with what right now Said the condor to the preying mantis
We're gonna lose this place just like we lost Atlantis
Brother we got to go sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune, she said that nothing showed
Who put the bomb on the sacred altar?
Why should we die if it comes our way?
Why should we care about a little button
Being pushed by someone we don't even know?

Well. I wish I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru

If you want to get high, build a strong foundation
Sink those pylons deep now and reach for the sky
If you want to get lost in the jungle rhythm
Get down on the ground and pretend you're swimming
If you want to put ice in the lava river
First you must climb, then you must stand and shiver
Brother we got to go sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune 
She said that nothing showed


Said the condor to the preying mantis
We're gonna lose this place just like we lost Atlantis
Brother we got to go sooner than you know
The Gypsy told my fortune 
She said that nothing showed
Who put the bomb on the sacred altar?
Why should we die if it comes our way?
Why should we care about a little button
Being pushed by someone we don't even know?


I feel sad, but I feel happy
As I'm coming back to home
There's a bridge across the river
That I have to cross alone
Like a skipping rolling stone
Like an Inca Trying to remember what my daddy said
Before too much time took away his head
He said we're going back and i'll show you what i'm talking about
Going back to cypress river, back to the old farmhouse

(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
(Trying to remember what daddy said)
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)

I tried to tell the people but they never heard a word i say
They say there's nothing out there but wheat fields anyway
Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry in her back yard
Out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard


Late at night, lights dancing in the northern sky
Like the indian spirits trying to show me how to fly
You can see into the future but it may be a mirage
Like a new car sitting there in your old garage


There's a place on the prairie where evil and goodness play
Daddy told me all about it but i don't remember what he said
It might be afternoon and it might be the dead of night
But you'll know when you see it cause it sure is a hell of a sight

(Prairie wind blowing through my head)

Before too much time took away his head
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
He said we're going back and i'll show you what i'm talking about
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)

(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
Going back to cypress river, back to the old farmhouse
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
(Prairie wind blowing through my head)
(Trying to remember what daddy said)
(Prairie wind blowing through my head) When we were living together
I thought that
I knew you would stay
Still when you left me
I tried to pretend
We could make it some way

I don't care
If all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair
That I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

It's hard enough losing
Without the confusion
Of knowing I tried
But you've made your mind up
That I'll be alone now
There's nothing to hide

I don't care
If all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair
That I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)
I don't care
If all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair
That I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)
I don't care
If all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair
That I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?) Looking at the grave
At the scenery around you
Home of the brave
Sometimes they leave you
Like they found you
Sometimes they worship you
Sometimes they
Tear your houses down
Sometimes they comfort you
Sometimes they
Spread your life around

Nothing you can see
That they
Won't try to give you
Land of the free
Where the legend
Will outlive you
When you earn their trust
When you are truly in danger
Where greed and lust
Have never been a stranger
Home of the brave
That's where
Heroes need protection
Media image slaves
Live by random selection
You sell your heart
But that's not
The price of freedom
Where things are useful
Only when you need them
Where will you go
When you need
To make some changes
Who will you love
In a world
Of constant strangers
I'll go with you
If you want
To take a hero home
I'll stay behind
If you want
To take a hero home


Home of the brave When I watch you sleeping
There’s nothing that you hide
When I smell you breathing
There’s a sweetness from inside
And when I feel you stirring
And the day is about to break
Outside wings are whirring
And the sky is there to take

I wonder how I got so close to you
And see the chances that you take
Without thinking I’m going there too
These are the promises you make
When your eyes are blinded by love
And the history of fate

When I hear you purring
Like a kitten and a lion
And I feel your softness
How you got it without trying
Then you roll and tumble
With your dreams still holding on
And I hear that rumble
In the stomach of the dawn

Today I paint my masterpiece
Tonight I trace my tears
Thinking through the road I took to you
And where I stumbled through the years


Today I paint my masterpiece
Tonight I trace my tears
Thinking through my path to you
And where I stumbled through the years
That’s when I knew I’d never hold you down
Repeating old roads and fears

Now the crows are calling
And the blackbirds sing in my ear
You got one eye open
And I’m smiling through my tears
But you’ll never see them
They're inside with my fears
In a place that’s fading away
And taking on new years I feel your love
I feel your strong love
I feel the patience among conditional love
I feel a strength
I feel your faith in me
I'll never let you down no matter what you do
If you just walk with me and let me walk with you
I'm on this journey I don't wanna walk alone
Walk with me
Walk with me
Shine me a light
Walk with me
I lost some people I was traveling with
I missed a soul in the old friendship I'm proud to be a union man
I make those meetings when I can, yeah
I pay my dues ahead of time
When the benefits come I'm last in line, yeah
I'm proud to be a union man

Every fourth Friday at 10 am
There's a local meeting of the A F of M, yeah!
""This meeting will now come to order. Is there any new business?""
""Yeah, I think 'Live music are better' bumper stickers should be issued""
""What was that?""
""'Live music is better' bumper stickers should be issued""
""The gentleman says 'Live music is better' bumper stickers should be issued
All in favor of what he said signify by saying 'aye'""
""Aye!, Aye!""
""If, however, you are opposed signify by saying 'no'""
I'm proud to be a union man One morning when I was riding in my old pickup truck
A beautiful bluebird came flying down
My eyes caught the color, as it lead me down the road
Dipping and bobbing in the sun

Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home

I've never seen that blue before, except in one place
And she's not here with me right now
And just like a lover, I watched her fly away
And that's what I remember now


If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying home to you Out on the trans-Canada highway
There was a girl
Hitchhiking with her dog
Fireflies buzzing round her head
Like candles in the fog

He was three miles down the road
Trying to stay up
But he knew that he couldn't
She was looking
For a ride through the night
But out there, who wouldn't

They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two comets heading for a bed

She had a new way of living
New way of looking at life
He had an
'84 International and two kids
He left back home with his wife

He was tired of
Writing letters to himself
And living in the dark
She was open to suggestions
And some say
She had a broken heart
He had everything he wanted
Until it all
Turned out to be a job
One fallen asleep trucker
And a girl
Hitchhiking with her dog



Out on the trans-Canada highway
The sun came climbing up the cab
By the time it hit the window
They were waking up
From what little sleep they had
When that heat hit the blankets
They were looking
For love at second sight
Just staring in each others eyes
Finding it in the morning light

They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two blankets laying on a bed There's a place called Downtown
Where the hippies all go
And they dance the charleston
And they do the limbo
Yeah the hippies all go there
'Cause they want to be seen
It's like a room
Full of pictures
It's like a psychedelic dream

Downtown
Let's go downtown
Downtown at night
Downtown
Let's have a party
Downtown at night

Yeah it's
Right around the corner
Up and down the hill
When you hear the band playing
It's gonna give you a chill
Give your money to the gateman
Young blood in his eye
Hold on to your baby
When you slip into the sky


Jimi's playing in the back room
Led Zeppelin on stage
There's a mirror ball twirling
And a note from Page
Like a water-washed diamond
In a river of sin
Going down like a whirlpool
When you get sucked in See the bluebird fly easy as a dream
Dipping and bobbing in the sun
Could she be the one i saw so long ago
Could she be the one to take me home
This pasture is green
I'm walking in the sun
It's turning brown
I'm standing in the rain
My overcoat is worn
The pockets are all torn
I'm moving away from the pain

Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Ring, ring
The old church bell
The bride and her love
Seeking guidance from above

Amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind
I'm hearing willie singing on the radio again
That song from 9/11 keeps ringing in my head
I'll always remember something Chris Rock said
Don't send no more candles
No matter what you do
Then willie stopped singing
And the prairie wind blew
The green kept rolling on
For miles and miles
Fields of fuel rolling on for miles

Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Toll, toll
The fallen soldier bell
The old church on the hill
Still standing when so many fell

Back when i was young, the birds blocked out the sun
Before the great migration south
We only shot a few
They last the winter through
Mother cooked them good and served them up
Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair
Behind a big wooden desk
The caribou we killed mean nothing to him
He took his money just like all the rest

Tick-tock
The clock on the wall
No wonder we're losing time
Ring, ring
Ring the wedding bells
The bride takes the ring
And the happy people sing Ain't getting old
Ain't getting younger though
Just getting used
To the lay of the land
I ain't tongue-tied
Just don't got nothing to say
I'm proud to be living in the U.S.A

Ready to go, willing to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A
So my sweet love can dance
Another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A

In history we painted pictures grim
The devil knows
We might feel that way again
The big wind blows
So the tall grass bends
But for you don't
Push too hard my friend


Got people here
Down on their knees and praying
Hawks and doves
Are circling in the rain
Got rock and roll
Got country music playing
If you hate us, you just
Don't know what you're saying

Ready to go, willing to stay and pay
U.S.A., U.S.A
So my sweet love can dance
Another free day
U.S.A., U.S.A Why are you growing up so fast
My boy?
Oh, you'd better take your time
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?

Almost time to live your dream
My boy
Oh, you'd better take your time
Almost time to make some plans
My son

Vacation gone, school is out
Summer ends year in year out

Oh, you'd better take your time
My boy
I thought we had just begun
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?


Why are you growing up so fast
My boy?
Why are you growing up so fast
My son? I just have this song I gotta sing for you. I finally think I found it. Oh I know all those old songs, really, I still know ""The Changes"". And sometimes I feel like a green Wurlitzer. I love it when ya, you know, when you ask me for those old songs and everything but, it's funny 'cause what keeps you alive is what kills you you know, and you get - too much of the old shit you know, uh, good night
So here's a song I wrote especially for you, especially you loud boisterous mothers out there, I can hear ya. Just pretend you can hear that old pool hall clankin' in the background
I know you can relate to this song, it's a song I wrote about myself. It's called ""Too Far Gone"". Even though there've been - maybe nine songs with the same title in the last two years, I don't let things like that bother me. If I'm too far gone I got the right to say it, right?
Okay. Just checkin' with ya. It's 'cause of this abyss here. It's 'cause of this hole between us that I have to keep re - re-affirming ourselves, ya know. Like I sh- Here we go anyway. I was gonna tell you somethin', about, I was gonna tell you somethin', but - okay alright I'll tell ya okay, then I'll do the song. We'll be here a long time. Okay, that's not it. That's not it. Just think of this as George burns his cigar. When I look down here in the pit, when I did an earlier show tonight, I just wanna tell you that uh, I don't know if any other artists who ever play here, I use the word, uh, loosely, uh, before has told you this, but uh, down in the pit there uh, right down in here... can I have a little light on that so that people can see? Uh can you light up the pit please? Well anyway I wanna tell ya folks, you don't have to be able to see me to hear what I'm saying. What I'm gonna tell you is I saw Judy Garland down there tonight earlier. She was wearing a red dress, with red lipstick, and she had some, yeah uh, little bit of music with her right here uh, one of those music folios, it said ""Somewhere over the rainbow"", had a picture of her as a little girl looking up at me with the blue sky behind her, and there she was, Judy Garland in a red dress with a piece of music and she looked up and she said ""How's the business Neil?"". You don't have to believe me Instrumental in six parts:
(2 guitars, bass guitar, 2 violins and drums) Some see life as a broken promise
Some see life as an endless fight
They think they live in the age of darkness
They think they live in the age of Light
It's an angry world
And everything is gonna be all right
Yeah it's an angry world
Yeah it's an angry world
Some see life as hope eternal
Some see life as a business plan
Some will go to hell's inferno
For screwing up their life in freedom land
It's an angry world
For the business man and the fisher man
It's an angry world
And no doubt everything will go as planned
Yeah it's an angry world
Yeah it's an angry world (Doo-wah, walk walk)

(Doo-wah, talk talk)
Wonderin'
(Doo-wah, talk talk) Here in the conscious world
We place our theories down
Why man must bring us
To our knees
Before he sees the weakness
Of his sinful plan
The power in his hand
Will never touch a friend

Throw your hatred down
Throw your hatred down

Meanwhile in the underworld
The weaknesses are seen
By peasants and presidents
Who plan the counter-scheme
Children in the schoolyard
Finish choosing teams
Divided by their dreams
While a TV screams


The wheel of fortune
Keeps on rolling down
The street that's paved
With sinful plans
There but for circumstance
May go you or I
Dressed in gold lame
Find a place to stay Soldier, your eyes
They shine like the sun
I wonder why
Soldier, your eyes
Shine like the sun
I wonder why
Jesus, I saw you
Walking on the river
I don't believe you
You can't deliver right away
I wonder why
Jesus, your eyes
Shine like the sun
I wonder why Sit by my side, come as close as the air
Share in a memory of gray
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures
That I play of changes
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die, trapped within
The circle time parade of changes
Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind
Visions of shadows that shine
One day I returned and found that they were
Victims of the vines of changes
The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze
A race around the stars, a journey through
The universe ablaze with changes
Moments of magic will glow in the night
Fears of the forest are all gone
But when the morning breaks they're swept away by
Golden drops of dawn, of changes
Passions will part to a strange melody
As fires will sometimes burn cold
Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver
Strings of souls, of changes
Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine we'll pour
And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on
The rolling river shores of changes The bridge, we'll build it now
It may take a lot of time
And it may be lonely but
Ooh baby, ooh baby
The bridge was falling down
And that took a lot of lies
And it made me lonely
Ooh baby, ooh baby

The bridge was falling 

One day, when you talked to me
I saw myself again
And it made me love you
Ooh baby, ooh baby
And love came running down
Like a river on your skin
And you let me in
Ooh babe, ooh babe

You let me in 

The bridge, we'll build it now
It may take a lot of time Good to see you
Good to see you again
Good to see your face again
Good to see you

I'm the suitcase in your hallway
I'm the footsteps on your floor
When I'm looking down on you
I feel like
I know what my life is for


I've been down the endless highway
I've passed on the solid line
Now at last I'm home to you
I feel like making up for lost time Instead of cursing the darkness
Light a candle for where we're going
There's something ahead, worth fighting for

When the light of time is on us
You will see our moment come
And the living soul inside will carry on

It's a chance to give new meaning to every move we make
In the cavern, in the cave, where we come from

When the light of dawn is on us
We will see what we can be
And the ancient ones can sleep an easy sleep
In the hallways of the ages, on the road to history
What we do now will always be with us


Instead of cursing the darkness
Light a candle for where we're going
There's something ahead, worth looking for


Light a candle in the darkness
So others might see ahead
Light a candle in the darkness, when you go Peace and love
Flying so high
Peace and love
Too young to die
Peace and love

Now you decide
Stay for the children
You don't really want to go
Can't feel it
Pulling like you did


Only a ride
Strength is gone
Dying inside
Tell me now
What did you find
Found love in the people
Living in a sacred land
Found love in the people


Found love found hate
Saw my mistake
Broke walls of pain
To walk again
I saw the dream
I saw the wake
We shared it all
But not the take


Lennon's goodbye
Over Now
Living in time
A broken bell
A nursery rhyme
Deserted by heroes
Strangers in your own land
No way to deny you
No way to deny you


I took it all
I took the oath
I took it all
Til I had most
I took what's left
I gave it breath
I had it all once
I gave it back Well I can't stop working
'Cause I like to work
When nothing else is going on
It's bad for the body
But it's good for the soul
Might even keep you breathing
When you lose control
Can't stop working
Can't stop working
Where've I been
For all these years
I thought I knew you better
Come on down to the edge of the sea today
And write a letter there in the sand
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
I can't stop working
Well I can't stop working
'Cause I like to work
When nothing else is going on
It's bad for the body
But it's good for the soul
Might even keep me breathing
When I lose  control
Can't stop working
Can't stop working
I might take some time off
I can't stop working
Might take time off for forgiveness
Forgiveness
I can't stop working ""There must be some kind of way out of here""
Said a joker to the thief
""There is too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Ploughmen dig my earth
None of them anywhere along the line
Know what any of it is worth""
""No reason to get excited""
The thief he softly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this not our fate
And let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late""
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl People on the street need a place to go 
Walking with the beat if it's not too slow 
When the night's dark shadow falls
On the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls

People on the street need a place to go 

Walking through the night up and down the avenue
Looking for a place
A place to go, a place to go
There's a muffled scream from the alley scene
From the alley scene comes a muffled scream
And the siren wails while the system fails
In the steaming heat people walk in the street
People can't run and hide
If you want to feel good then you gotta feel good inside


Rising through the grates come the fumes of industry
Floating to the sky Keep walking with the beat
Walking with the beat
Keep walking with the beat, walking with the beat 
When the night's dark shadow falls
On the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls I remember long ago
How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards
Cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

Land of beauty
Space and light
Land of promise
Land of might
You're my home now
And it's true
California, here's to you

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye


California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

The golden state! In the canyons of the great divide
Familiar places
That we can run and hide
Are filled with strangers
Walking in our houses alone

In the great divide
Nothing to decide
No one else to care for or love
In the great divide
You won't fit in too well

On the horses of the carousel
She rides alone with you and me
She rides like she knows
Wherever she goes, we'll be there
On the carousel
Life is going well
Anyone can tell, we're in love
On the Carousel
You're gonna like the way you feel
You and I we got caught down there
In the twisted canyons
Of the great divide
We walked the floor
Now we don't go there anymore ""My Pledge""
If it please the court I've had a lot to say
And it's not always been true
Standing here before you, judge
I make my pledge of truth to you
The waves came over the bow
The decks awash with running green and foam
Back there at the wheel I was terrified
Next day we first saw home
My relatives came over on the Mayflower
Landed on the shore almost alone
Now that damn traffic today is terrible
And everywhere I look I see people alone
Alone with their heads looking in their hands
Lost in the conversation stare
Walking with their eyes looking at the screen
Talking like they were really there
I'm lost in this new generation
Left me behind it seems
Listening to the shadow of Jimi Hendrix
""Purple Haze"", sounding like TV
I stepped on someone's hand laying on the street
Both asleep and dead it may seem
He didn't even move there on the sidewalk
I stood there staring in a dream
She came along in her uniform
Stood moving me away with a gentle hand
Dressed in white like a nightingale
Her name was Florence, Florence of the Land
(I knew I'd seen her somewhere)
I knew I'd seen her somewhere
But she was busy with him gone
She came with three different brothers
Abraham, Martin and John
I heard a song about that once
And I never knew what it meant
Three stars died in a plane one night
Rock and Roll, the message that was sent
I couldn't wrap my head around it
Didn't know what it meant
Standing there on that sandy beach
Watching it turn to cement
Now I don't see all the colors
And I might miss some of their beauty
But I do see what I see
And I want to do my duty
Enlisted in the Navy at the corner store
They had a recruiting booth
I covered my heart and raised my hand
And swore it was the truth
That's my pledge
That's my pledge
That's my pledge, judge
That's my pledge Can't forget
What happened yesterday
Though my friends say
Don't look back
I can feel it
Coming through me
Like an echo
Like a photograph Used to play
In a rock 'n' roll band
But they broke up
We were young and we were wild
It ate us up
Now I'm not saying
Who was right or wrong
Looking out on a big green lawn
Girls and boys
Playing in the afternoon sun
Life's a joy
I heard an old song
Playing on the radio

Buffalo Springfield again

I'd like to see those guys again
And give it a shot
Maybe now we can show the world
What we've got
But I'd just like to play
For the fun we had Well, his cattle each have numbers
And they all eat in a line
When he turns the floodlights
On each night
Of course the herd looks perfect!
Computer Cowboy
Well, he rides the range until midnight
And the wild coyotes yowl
As he trots beneath the floodlights
And of course the rhythm is perfect!
Computer Cowboy
Ride along computer cowboy
To the city just in time
To bring another system down
And leave your alias behind

Computer syscrusher 
Crusher. Syscrusher, Syscrusher
Come a ky ky yippee yi yippee yi ay
Come a ky ky yippee yi ay
Come a ky ky yippee yi yippee yi ay
Come a ky ky yippee yi ay
Computer syscrusher There's a battle raging on the sacred land
Our brothers and sisters had to take a stand
Against us now for what we all been doing
On the sacred land there's a battle brewing

I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

Now it's been about 500 years
We keep taking what we gave away
Just like what we call Indian givers
It makes you sick and gives you shivers

I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

Big money going backwards and ripping the soil
Where graves are scattered and blood was boiled
When all who look can see the truth
But they just move on and keep their groove

I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

Saw Happy locked to the big machine
They had to cut him loose and you know what that means
That's when Happy went to jail
Behind big money justice always fails

I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news

Bring back the days when good was good
Lose these imposters in our neighborhood
Across our farms and through our waters
All at the cost of our sons and squaw daughters
Yeah our brave sons and daughters
We're all here together fighting poison waters
Standing against the evil way
That's what we have at the end of day

I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news
I wish somebody would share the news You can say the soul is gone
And the feeling is just not there
Not like it was so long ago

On the empty page before you
You can fill in what you care
Try to make it new before you go
Take the simple case of the sarge
Who can't go back to war
Because the hippies
Tore down everything
That he was fighting for
Or the lovers on the blankets
That the city turned to whores
With memories
Of green kissed by the sun

You can say the soul is gone
And close another door
Just be sure
That yours is not the one

And I'm singing for the stringman
Who lately lost his wife
There is no dearer friend of mine
That I know in this life
On his shoulder rests a violin
For his head where chaos reigns
But his heart
Can't find a simple way
To live with all those things
All those things
He's a stringman
A stringman
All those strings to pull Won't need no shadow man
Runnin' the government
Won't need no stinkin' war
Won't need no haircut
Won't need no shoe shine

After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
What will people do
After the garden is gone?
What will people say
After the garden?

Won't need no strong man
Walkin' through the night
To live a weak man's day
Won't need no purple haze
Won't need no sunshine

After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
Where will people go
After the garden is gone?
What will people know
After the garden?

After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone Well, you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same
Down by the club on the parking lot cinders
I was to meet him and play his game
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
I saw his face in the attic window
Yelling down through the broken pane
Sinner man!
What you got to run for?
Church bells rang when he said that name
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
Well, I was about as scared as I could be
I went and hid behind the nearest tree
Peeked out
From behind the branches
Sinner!
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
To get down

I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same John Oaks is in the neighborhood
Protecting all the trees
He's the master of irrigation
And he knows what he sees
Great farmers watering everywhere
Pipes running where they please
John sees his laws are broken
Trees drowning where they breathe
Now John used to be a mellow man
Drinking chai and smoking weed
Ain't no one in the county
Ever seen what he seen
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
Old John rides in his pickup
With rakes and friends in the back
Workers he takes with him
Then he drives them all back
To protect them from the politicians
Using them to get ahead
Preying on the people
Trying to get inside their heads
John Oaks is really stand up
He won't take shit lying down
He calls it like he sees it
And he puts his money down
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
One day at the demonstration
John Oaks was standing up
He arrive there at the location
In his old pickup truck
Took a rake in his hand
And his workers by his side
Stood there waiting for his turn
To speak and turn the tide
When he found himself surrounded
By police everywhere
They tried to take his workers to jail
When he grabbed one by his hair
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
Shots rang out and people yelled
As the police took control
Shot a black man right where he fell
With a sniper on the knoll
John Oaks saw law and order
Was leading him astray
Tried to get back in his pickup
With his workers to get away
That's when the police moved in
And stood there in his way
John started up his pickup
And that was his last day
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
They said he had a pistol
When the old pickup backfired
And there shot him there behind the wheel
And then John Oaks expired
The workers grabbed the rakes
And that's all that I can say
They went to the cemetery
And they stay there to this day
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks
John Oaks The flash of a distant camera
Reconnecting
Thoughts and actions
Fragments of our missing dreams
Pieces from here and there
Fall in place along the line
Disappearing between you and me
Life is changing everywhere I go
New things and old both disappear
If life is a photograph
Fading in the mirror

All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing for you
All I need is this song of love
To sing for you

On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones
That missed their chances
When they couldn't let it show
Lies the land of sweet surrender
Like a dream
It might have ended there
But we didn't even know
Now forever we will live as one
Floating in love's atmosphere
If love is a piece of dust
Shining in the sun


Song of love My old dad went a walking one day
Pushing tall weeds
Right outta his way
My old dad went a walking one day

Hey now, hey now

Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right


Old man crossing the road
You've got to let him go
Old man crossing the road
He's feeling fine

Daddy went a riding in his old car
Took the dog with him
Cause it ain't too far
Daddy went riding in his old car
Hey now, hey now

Brown leather boots
And an old straw hat
Daddy's getting wood
With the barnyard cat
Got a little dirty
But that's all right
Hey now, hey now


Mama's waiting
At the top of the hill
They'll be laughing
Oh the stories they'll tell
When he holds her
In his arms again
They'll be sweethearts
With time on their hands



Corduroy pants
And an old plaid shirt
Daddy went a walking
Just to feel the earth
Got a little dirty
But that's all right I just want to thank you
For all of the things you've done
I'm thinking about you
I just want to send my love
I send my best to you
That's my message of love
For all the things you did
I can never thank you enough

Feel like i'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
Falling off the face of the earth
(Falling)
Feel like i'm falling
Falling off the face of the earth
Falling off the face of the earth
Oh

I just want to tell you
You sure mean a lot to me
It may sound simple
But you are the world to me
It's such a precious thing
That time we shared together
I must apologize
For the troubled times Saw your friend
Working in this hotel
Says he used to know you when
And your dreams
Lucky as they seemed
They all
Turned their back on him

Truth be known
Truth be known

Way I feel tonight
Living in
This back street town
'Bout my dreams
They all seem to fade
As soon as
I put my money down


When the fire
That once was your friend
Burns your fingers to the bone
And your song
Meets a sudden end
Echoing
Through right and wrong Trippin' down that old Hippie Highway
Got to thinkin' 'bout you again
Wonderin' how it really was for you
And how it happened in the end
But I guess I'll never know the truth
If you were really all alone
We were just a couple'a kids then
Livin' each and every day
When we both went down to register
We were laughin' all the way
That's when we named it The Hippie Highway
I still call it that today
Roger and out good buddy
I still call it that today
Two Camaros racing down the road
Feels just like yesterday
Roger and out good buddy
I feel you in the air today
I know you gave for your country
I feel you in the air today
Roger and out good buddy When we go for a little walk
Out on the land
When we're just walking and holding hands
You can take it as a sign of love
When the winds of fate
Keep blowing and we both understand

Sign of love
It's a sign of love
Sign of love

When we both have silver hair
And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine
You can take it as a sign of love
When I look at you
When I'm looking at you for a long, long time


When I first saw you
You were just a girl
And I was a man
While the music played
I watched you dance Back in the days of shock and awe
We came to liberate them all
History was the cruel judge of overconfidence
Back in the days of shock and awe
Back in the days of ""mission accomplished""
Our chief was landing on the deck
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
Back in the days of ""mission accomplished""
Thousands of bodies in the ground
Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound
No one sees them coming home that way
Thousands buried in the ground
Thousands of children scarred for life
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife
Both sides are losing now
Heaven takes them in
Thousands of children scarred for life
We had a chance to change our mind
But somehow wisdom was hard to find
We went with what we knew and now we can't go back
But we had a chance to change our mind One day shots rang across the peaceful valley
God was crying tears that fell like rain
Before the railroad came from Kansas City
And the bullets hit the bison from the train
First shots rang across the peaceful valley
And the white man laid his foot upon the plain
The wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon
The settlers full of wonder as they crossed
A gentle creek where two old oaks were standing
Before the west was won there was a cost
A rain of fire came down upon the wagons
A mother screamed and every soul was lost
Change hit the country like a thunderstorm
Ancient rivers soon began to boil
People rushed like water to California
At first they came for gold and then for oil
Fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes
Mother earth took poison in her soil
An Electra Cruiser coasted towards the exit
And turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard
""People make the difference"" read a billboard
Above a long line of idling cars
Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead the nations
And protect God's creations
A polar bear was drifting on an ice floe
Sun beating down from the sky
Politicians gathered for a summit
And came away with nothing to decide
Storms thundered on, his tears of falling rain
A child was born and wondered why I'm a dirty old man
I do what I can
Trying to make a living
I'm a dirty old man

I like to get hammered
On Friday night
Sometimes I can't wait
So Monday's alright
It's a battle with the bottle
I'll win it alright
But I lost another round
In the bar last night


Yeah, I'm going to get fired
For drinking on the job
Got caught with the boss' wife
In the parking lot
I'm going to get killed
For doing this again
But I just can't help it
It's under my skin

I'm a dirty old man
I do what I can
I'm going to get hammered
And do it again


Got a bag of frozen peas
I use on my knees
I injured from begging
And trying to please
If you believe that
I'm losing my fat
Got a workout program
And a new rubber mat

I'm a dirty old man

It's a battle with the bottle
I'll win it alright
But I lost another round
In the bar last night
I'm a dirty old man Well I took you for a walk
Up on the forest floor
Because I wanted to share some things
But it sure looked to me
Like you've been there before
It was such a natural thing

You're my girl
(My girl)
And you're showing me now
Just how grown up you are
You're my girl
(My girl)
And I'll be letting you go someday

Please don't tell me that
You're leaving me just yet
Because I know I got to let you go
(Let you go)
Please don't tell me that
You're saying goodbye
(Say good bye)

Well I lit a candle
On the Fourth of July
But it didn't bring you home to me
You went heading into summer
On a natural high
With the world at your feet

It's your time
(Your time)
And you're showing me now
Just how grown up you are
It's your time
(Your time)
And I'll be letting you go someday


We went looking for faith
On the forest floor
And it showed up everywhere
In the sun and the water
And the falling leaves
The falling leaves of time


Please don't tell me that
You're leaving me quite yet
Because I know I got to let you go
Please don't tell me that
You're saying goodbye In the morning when you wake up
You've got planes flying in the sky
Flying bombs made to break up
All the lies in your eyes

There's a man says
He can put an end to war

They shot George Wallace down
He'll never walk around
Our mines are sleeping in the sea
Blow those bridges down
And burn that jungle down
And kill those Vietnamese I wanna drive my car, I wanna drive my car
Further and further on down the road
I wanna drive my car

I need a place to go, I need a place to go
Further and further on down the road
I need a place to go

I gotta find my way, I gotta find my way
Further and further on down the road
I gotta find my way

I wanna drive my car, I wanna drive my car
Further and further on down the road
I wanna drive my car

I gotta find some fuel, I gotta find some fuel
Further and further on down the road
I gotta find some fuel It's awful hard to find a job
On one side the government
The other the mob
Hey, hey ain't that right
The working man's in for a hell of a fight

Oh, this country
Sure looks good to me
But these fences are
Coming apart at every nail

Way up on the old dew line
Some of the boys were feeling fine
A big light flashed across the sky
But something else went slipping by
Meanwhile at the Pentagon
The brass was a wondering what went wrong


Hey hey, ain't that right
The working man's in for a hell of a fight Are you passionate?
Are you living like you talk?
Are you dreaming now
That you're going to the top?
Are you negative
In a world that never stops

Turning on you?
Turning on me?
Turning on you?

Are you loving it?
Can you ever get enough of it?
Is it everything?
A love that never stops

Coming to you?
Coming to me?
Coming to you?

Once i was a soldier
I was fighting in the sky
And the gunfire kept
Coming back on me
So i dove into the darkness
And i let my missiles fly
And they might be the ones
That kept you free
Once i was a prisoner
I was riding in a truck
Cleaned up for public display
I looked at those around me
And when they looked at me
I let them see my soul that day
Are you scared of it?
Do you wish that it would stop?
Does it bother you
When you hear your spirit talk?
Well i'm right with you
Yes i'm right with you

It's working on me
It's working on you
It's working on me The people have heard the news
The people have spoken
You may not like what they said
But they weren't joking
Way out on the desert sands
Lies a desperate lover
They call her the ""Queen of Oil""
So much to discover
Don't need no ad machine
Telling me what I need
Don't need no Madison Avenue war
Don't need no more boxes I can see
Covered in flags but I can't see them on TV

Don't need no more lies 

The restless consumer flies
Around the world each day
With such an appetite for taste and grace
People from around the world
Need someone to listen
We're starving and dying from our disease
We need your medicine
How do you pay for war
And leave us dying?
When you could do so much more
You're not even trying
Don't need no TV ad
Telling me how sick I am
Don't want to know how many people are like me
Don't need no dizziness
Don't need no nausea
Don't need no side effects like diarrhea or sexual death

Don't need no more lies

The restless consumer lies
Asleep in her hotel
With such an appetite
For anything that sells
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
Need someone to listen
People are dying here and there
They don't see the world the way you do
There's no mission accomplished here
Just death to thousands
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
Cry out in unison
Don't need no terror squad
Don't want no damned Jihad
Blowing themselves away in my hood
But we don't talk to them
So we don't learn from them
Hate don't negotiate with good


The restless consumer flies
Around the world each day
With such an appetite for efficiency
And pace Hi mom!
Hey, it’s great to be able to talk to you
Ah, I haven’t been able to talk to you in really a long time
And ah, my friend Jack has got this box that I can talk to you from
So I’d like to be able to send you this message
And tell you how much I love you and also tell you
That I think you should start talking to daddy again
Since you’re both there together there’s no reason not to talk
And also, um, you know how we used to watch the weather all the time
On TV, and we used to know what was happening, ah, you know up there in Winnipeg
And ah, well I met this guy named Al and he’s, um, he’s the weatherman now for the whole planet
If you can imagine that, and ah, he’s uh, sometime’s not popular because, uh
This is very strange but, you know people turn on the weatherman
When the weather is gonna be bad, they actually turn on the weatherman
And uh, say bad things about him and put him down
So, so uh, things haven’t been that great lately, uh
You know, day by day is really good, uh, you know most of the time
But every once in a while all hell breaks loose, mom
And the whole thing is just like nothing I’ve ever seen before
And it, it seems to be happening everywhere
So ah, you know if you’re in there, everywhere all the time
All around the whole globe, around earth
So you know, even though Al’s forecasts are good he gets in trouble
So ah, you know I always know we used to watch the weather forecast together
So I thought I’d tell you about that and ah, I miss you
And I know that ah, I-I know that ah, you know I’d like you to say hello to Ben for me
Ah and, tell him that you know that I’ll be around, ah, I’ll be there eventually
Ah, not for a while though, I still have a lot of work to do here
And ah, and so I love you, and ah I hope eveybody’s feeling good up there
And don’t forget to talk to daddy, bye! Up and down the old homestead
The naked rider gallops through his head
And although the moon isn't full
He still feels the pull

Out on the floor where the cowboys dance
Approaching slowly at a glance
Here comes the shadow of his stance
The reins are falling from his hands

Why do you ride that crazy horse?
Inquires the shadow with little remorse
Just then a priest comes down the stairs
With a sack of dreams and old nightmares

Who are you, the rider says
You dress in black but you talk like a Fed
You spout ideas from books that you read
Don't you care about this guy's head?

Just then the sound of hoof beats was heard
And the sky was darkened by a prehistoric bird
Who flew between the unfulfilled moon
And the naked rider, to a telephone booth

We'll call the moon and see what's up
I've got some change in this little tin cup
We'll say that the shadow is growing dim
And we need some light to get back to him

Just one call should do it all
I'll carve this number on the wall with my beak

Flying feathers were all around
The air was filled with a ringing sound
Two more birds, the second and the third
Came down from the sky to deliver the word

Where have you been, they said to the first
Get back to the clouds, we're dying of thirst
There's not enough time to make that call
Let's ditch this rider, shadow and all

The sky was filled with the beautiful birds
Still on the ground some crying was heard
With his dime in his hand and his hand on the dial
His ears were sweating as he forced a smile

Hoof beats beating across the range
He rode through the night with his cup of change
Tired and beaten he fell into slumber
But up in the sky they still had his number

Up and down the old homestead
The naked rider gallops through his head
And although the moon isn't full
He still feels the pull
Still feels the pull
Still feels the pull
Still feels the pull
Still feels the pull Today's the day our younger son
Is going off to war
Fighting in the age old battle
We've sometimes won before
Flags that line old main street
Are blowing in the wind
These must be the flags of freedom flying

Church bells are ringing
As the families stand and wave
Some of them are crying
But the soldiers look so brave
Looking straight ahead
Like they know just where they're going
Past the flags of freedom flyin'
Sister has her headphones on
She hears the music blasting
She sees her brother marchin' by
Their bond is everlasting
Listening to Bob Dylan singing in 1963
Watching the flags of freedom flying
She sees the president speaking
On a Flat-screen TV
In the window of the old appliance store
She turns to see her brother again
But he's already walking past
The flags of freedom flying
Have you seen the flags of freedom?
What color are they now?
Do you think that you believe in yours
More than they do theirs somehow?
When you see the flags of freedom flying On the hill where Custer was
Making his last stand
With the Indians all around
And his gun in his hand
Such a wind was blowing that day
Through the battleground
I could feel it in my hair
As I turned towards downtown
Weaving through the buildings
Cutting though the streets
Slicing through the culture
Piling on the weeks

Going home, I'm going home 
Going home

Dropping in on you my friend
Is just like old times
Said the fool who signed the paper
To assorted slimes
It's hard to get blood from a stone
But for you I'll give it a try
To provide your accommodations
And leave you satisfied
You'd think it was easy
To give your life away
To not have to live up to
The promises you made


Elusively she cut the phone
Moved from cell to cell
Really looking remarkable
And obviously doing well
She made a turn on a wooden bridge
Into the battleground
With a thousand warriors on the ridge
She tried to turn her radio down
Battle drums were pounding
All around her car
She saw her clothes were changing
Into sky and stars Live with me 
Lost in space
I heard you were lost in space
That's such a lonely place
For you to be
Out of control
Singing with too much soul
I heard you got out on parole
Working for the queen
Gardening again
Landscape again
Keeping all the grounds
Around her clean
Working for the queen
Don't take out the magic pen
Don't draw on the infinity board
Your buildings, if they rise again
Would do much better
On the ocean floor
They'll never feel the way
They did before 
Out on the ocean floor 
What could be stranger than the unknown danger
That lies on the ocean floor?
Breakers crash on the beach
I count them like lambs in my sleep
They come at me steady
They know I'm not ready
They pound on my mattress door
Have they got a big one in store
Losing you
I heard I was losing you
That's not the only thing that I got to lose
I got to lose
The deep sea blues
Look at these blues
The deep sea blues
Live with me, live with me You are my special one
Made my heart come all undone
We've been having too much fun
Now someone else
Will sleep with tears
When he hears
What we've done

Oh, the ways of love
Oh, the ways of love

Hear my song
And hear my heart
We'll be gone
When the music starts
Then we'll never be apart
Just you and I
Go flying by
No one to cry
That we're gone Woke up this morning
To a glass accident
Glass fell in love with the floor
Too many pieces there for me to clean up
So I left a warning message by the door
""Danger"" on a scary skulls and crossbones
A piece of paper on the floor
Covered broken pieces of a love dream lingering there
That could do some damage for ever more
Just imagine what could go wrong
And how some lives could change forever
If you're not careful how you handle delicate things
But now is better than never
There was a lingering hope
That made it through the dark night
And threatened everything thereafter
A hope that was confusing
Looking like a bright light
Blinding you forever with its power
Woke up this morning to a glass accident
Glass fell in love with the floor
Too many pieces there for me to clean up
So I left a warning message by the door They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walking down the street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (on Broadway)
They say the women treat you right on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (on Broadway)
They say that I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But They're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway) When i was a growing boy
A-rocking on my daddy's knee
Daddy took an old guitar and sang
Bury me on the lone prairie
Uncle bob sat at the piano
My girl cousins sang harmony
Those were the good old family times
That left a big mark on me

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the canada geese once filled the sky
And then i won't be far from home
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
Because then i won't be far from home

Walking down the trans-canada highway
I was talking to a firefly
Trying to make my way to nashville, tennessee
When another car passed me by
Some day i'm gonna make big money
And buy myself a big old car
Make my way on down to that promised land
And then i'm gonna really go far Our love, baby, feels so right
When you're smiling in the morning light
I ain't leaving no way

'Cause we got staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin

Gold and diamonds say you're mine
But true love opens the gates of time
And as we go on our way

We got staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin


Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin
Staying power, you and I
Staying power through thick and thin The last time I saw Elvis
He was shooting at a colour TV
The phones were ringing in the pink motel
And the rest is history
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singing a gospel song
You could tell he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was up on the silver screen
Pushing a plough in a black and white movie
And everybody started to scream
Yes, he was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
It was some kind of Vegas dream
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape
And a blue-haired lady screamed
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was fronting a three-piece band
Rocking on the back of a flatbed truck
With an old guitar in his hand
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
The last time I saw Elvis
He was riding in a Pink Cadillac
Wind was blowing through his hair
And he never did look back
He was the king
He was the king
Thank you very much
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singing that gospel song
You could tell that he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king

He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king Got a pot belly
It's not too big
Gets in my way
When I'm driving my rig
Driving this country
In a big old rig
Things I've seen
Mean a lot
Friend has a pickup
Drives his kid to school
Then he takes his wife
To beauty school
Now she's doing nails
Going get a job
Got a good teacher
There's a fork in the road ahead
I don't know which way I'm going to turn
There's a fork in the road ahead
About this year
We salute the troops
They're all still there
In a fucking war
It's no good
Whose idea was that?
I've got hope
But you can't eat hope
I'm not done
Not giving up
Not cashing in
Too late

There's a bailout coming but it's not for me
It's for all those creeps watching tickers on TV
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me

I'm a big rock star
My sales have tanked
But I still got you
Thanks
Download this
Sounds like shit
Keep on blogging
Until the power goes out
Your battery's dead
Twist and shout
On the radio
Those were the days
Bring them back

There's a bailout coming but it's not for you
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you
Bailout coming but it's not for you

Got my flat screen
Got it repo would now
They picked it up
Left a hole in the wall
Last Saturday
Missed the Raider's game

There's a bailout coming but it's not for you
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do Across the plain
Flew the lone grey rider
Leather bag
Pounding on his back
Above the clouds the moon
Was climbing higher
A pack of wolves wanted
Their money back
With folded arms
The chief stood watching
Painted braves
Slipped down the hill
In his ears
The spirit talking
As they closed in
For an easy kill
At the house
The door was wide open
Wind blew
Curtains off the rod
She was waiting and hoping
She was praying to her god
He was luckier than most men
He was barely in his prime
As she stood there
In the doorway
Her long dress flowing
Would he make it this time
Over the hill
In the big green country
That's the place where
The cancer cowboy rides
Pure as the driven snow
Before it got him

Sometimes I feel like
He's all right
Sometimes I feel
Like a piece of paper
Sometimes I feel
Like my own name
Sometimes I feel
Different later
Sometimes I feel
I feel just the same Haven't a day goes by
I don't burn a little bit of my soul
Hasn't a day goes by
I don't burn a little bit of my soul
Scored some friends along the way
Did what I did, said what I had to say
And I'd do it all again if I had to today
When all is said and done
I'm the one

It's a long hard road
When your friends start
To leave you behind
It's a long hard road
When you try to find peace of mind
Some might go for poison
And some go for too much stuff
Some just go to sleep at night
And forget to wake up

Cocaine eyes
Can't hide your face
It's no surprise
You lose the race
Again

I'm the one, yeah

Cocaine eyes
It won't hide your face
It's no surprise
You lost the race
Once again
My old friend When I was a younger man
Got lucky with a rock 'n' roll band
Struck gold in hollywood
All that time I knew I would
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back in the barn again

Now when we hit the road
Big buses and trucks unload
After the curtain falls
Load up and then we all
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back on the road again Sometimes when I go walking among the tall trees
I feel the light coming down on me
Under moon, under sun, I feel the chosen one
Through the mist, come walking here with me
And the leaves on the ground make a rustling sound
In the wind now blowing in my face
It's that cool wind again, I feel my missing friend
Whose counsel I can never replace

Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
(Show me the way)
No more darkness, no more wasted time
(Show me the way)
Let me stay here with this heart of mine
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path
No hidden path

How you change, how you change
And how you rearrange, everything that touches me
Now you're her, now you're her
She's sleeping here with me, everything that touches me
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sand wash over you
Giving all that you can give
Will the Northern lights still play as we walk our distant days?
Giving all that we can give

Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
(Show me the way)
There's a cold wind blowing through my mind
(Show me the way)
But I'm holding on to the threads of time
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path, no hidden path

Will the Northern lights still play as we walk our distant days?
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sun wash over you

Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sun wash over you Up in that new space station
Living Kennedy's dream
There was an automatic camera
Shooting elephantine

Well the crew was relaxing
Before the video screen
Watching old re-runs
Of Mohammed Ali

The voice of Houston calling
Brought them back to the scene
Except the sky is falling
Do you know what that means?

Out on that Texas sidewalk
Through the hotel mezzanine
There walked a see-through hooker
To a suite with two TVs
But by the elevator
She began to sneeze
With an attack so uncontrolled
It brought her to her knees
And then the hotel doctor
With nurse and stethoscope
Announced the worst is over
But for her there is no hope
Way down in South Dakota
On the Needles Highway
There's a lone red rider
On the road today
And though his war is over
He's fighting on anyway
Although he's seldom sober
He's drinking whisky all day
Down in that old box canyon
Where only misfits can go
He rides with no companion
But saloon and rodeo
Up in that new space station
Living Kennedy's dream
There's an automatic camera
Shooting elephantine Fallen angel
Who's your savior tonight
You're surrounded
By these walls
And neon lights
Hungry people
Move like waves
Behind the beat

Where's the big drum

Where's the feel
Of body heat It's a lonely cup of coffee
'Cause my baby's gone
Someone has to work
I know that's true
Carpenters bring ladders
I bring love to you
Their working day beginning under skies of blue
Is just now getting started
And I'm sitting under a tree
Singing a song and thinking of you
My life has been so lucky
The package has arrived
I got my new robot from Amazon.com
Unpacking it now
I have a sense of pride
I'm going online to program it for you In the land of the broken hearted
People looking
For the horseshoe man
They've been
Picking up little pieces
They've been
Putting them all in his hand
And the way the story started
Two lovers long ago
Took a vow to live with heartbreak
Took a chance
But how could they know

...love?
How could they know love?
Love
How could they know love?

Horseshoe man's
Been working his magic
Fixing heartbreak everywhere
He's the one we all can count on
When we're lost
And don't know where love is
He takes the pieces in his hands
And shakes 'em up
Like he doesn't care
He says that there
Will always be heartbreak
Because love is everywhere  see things, when they show you
What they want you to know
Watch what you don't see, on the TV
When they hide the truth
Feel, how it hurts you
When the truth hides, behind the scenes
Cry, from the broken - hearted melody
That you hear in your dreams
 meets a runaway
Can you catch him?
It's not in your hands
Slow, easy does it, when you find out, what deception means
Try, try to change it
Cause it hurts you
And it holds back your dreams
Dreams of the New World
Evolution of the species to survive, truth that screams:
Call, in the darkness
For the moment, a clear thinking joy
Laugh, when you find out, that the story that's spoken, has broken like a toy
Lost, in the sandbox
Just left there, for no one to enjoy
Found, by the police
Who killed him, where filmed on the phone
Texas Rangers, had to ride in, to the rescue of all that's well and good
Texas Rangers, in pickups, painted silver, with bulldogs on the hood
Texas Rangers, come to save you, come to rescue the bad and the good
Texas Rangers, on the free way, and in your neighborhood
Texas Rangers
Texas Rangers
Texas Rangers
Texas Rangers In the summertime we met to see a threat
That came to harm something we both loved
And as the hours passed we talked until at last
It came the time to part

I was doing well and I thought she liked my style
I had no business thinking like that but it lasted quite a while
I got my promises made but before the timeless father
I showed plastic flowers to Mother Nature’s daughter

She held a vase, her misty gaze brought them to life
I was amazed, she turned to me with a tear in her eye

We went to give our thanks along the river banks
And watched the water flow as it rolled along
She scooped some river sand and held it in her hand
And sang a little song
We saw the water lines left there from ancient times
I watched the sand falling through her fingers
On the shore so dry

I was doing well, and I thought she liked my style
I had no business feeling like that but it lasted quite a while
I got my promises made but before the timeless father
I showed plastic flowers to Mother Nature’s daughter Preacher went up to the Golden Gate
And met God there
With the glow of love in his flowing hair
I'm dreaming of a time when love and music
Is everywhere
Can you see that time coming?
No my son that time has gone
There's things to do
The world has changed since I first met you
Back when The Band played Rock of Ages
In their prime
And the old juke joint was rocking

Oh Lord there's so much hate
In a world where we're from another place
Show me how to be like you
See no evil, hear no evil
Feel no evil in my heart

In my heart, in my aching heart
In my heart, in my heart
In my old black heart
In my heart, in my heart
In my beating heart

Sky had turned a lot of shades of gray
As they walked on
And a gentle rain fell down on them
They found faith in the way things are and
The way things change
And they said goodbye like two old friends
Take me up to the mountains high
Or a building top where the spirits fly
Show me how to be like you
See no evil, feel no evil
Fear no evil in my heart Shining light, you always showed me
You always guide me, I don't know where I'm going
Show me now, I'm waiting to see you
I'm waiting to feel you around me again
Show me your love, show me your kind love
Share your compassion, let me feel mine
Shed your light all around me
Now that you've found me and I've found you

Shining light, what will you show me now?
What can I bring to you to stand in your glow?
Shining light, when will you show your love?
When can I see you and stand in your glow?
Shed your light, show your love 

Shed your light, show your love
Shed your light, shed your light Where did all the feelings go?
What about that happy glow?
Was that so long ago
When we were first in love?
I didn't feel the change
Everything was still the same
And when that moment came
I didn't know
I miss the feeling
I miss the light
But I got faith in something
I'll never give up the fight
Why's it so heavy
This love of mine
I lost the feeling
I lost the time

I'd like to shake your hand
Disappointment
Looks like you win again
But this time might be the last

Let's say I got a habit
Let's say it's hard to break
Let's say we got to do something
Before it's just too late
I want to get you back
I don't know how to do that
I miss you loving me
The way you used to
I'm taking the blame myself
For living my life in a shell
And now I'm breaking out
But will you still be there?
Let's say that love is blind
Let's say that time is kind
Let's say that it's not over
Until it's over


I'm saving the best for last
Let's leave this all in the past
The beauty of loving you
Is what we've both been through
So now it's up to me
To set your spirit free
So you can swing again
On our gate Hold on to your love 
Though you may feel tired and blue
The things you say
The things you dream you might do
Come true if you
Hold on to your love

How long the day?
How dark the night spent apart?
Is this the way to learn?
Go your own way
Although you may break a heart
Don't let it start
Hold on to your love Don't say you love me
That's what she said
Don't say you love me
That's what she said

Hey baby
I'm your man
I know i treated you bad
But i'm doin' the best i can
Now is not the time
To cash it in
I'm with you babe
I've always been
And i got to tell you baby
That our love is strong
And i'm the one
The one that did you wrong


Hey baby
Don't count me out
I still got a lot to give
Stick around and find out
I might surprise you
With what our love still brings
I'm never quiting you
Even if you quit me
And i got to tell you baby
Our love is strong
And i'm the one
The one that did you wrong


Don't say you love me  If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the wind hits heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you go where the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and the summer ends
Please see for me she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
That's the way I remember her best
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the wind hits heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea! Got a woman that loves me
And I love her so
But she's all dressed up now
With nowhere to go
All our old hang-outs
Are boarded up and closed
Or being bought by somebody
Nobody knows
But things are not that bad
We still got the kids
We're going out to the movies
Right after this
Going back to school
Saving up my tuition
Going to rewrite all the rules
On the old blackboard
Cause it seems things today
There is no magic in them
They don't cut the grade
Like they used to

Depression blues
Nowhere to go
Being bought by somebody
Nobody knows

Is there anybody out there
With a voice loud and clear
Gonna sing all the words
We all want to hear Out on the road the traffic slowed down to a crawl
Strobe lights flashing on the overpass
The tangled steel could not reveal what no one saw
Or how he walked away without a scratch
He thought of her and walked along the exit ramp
He touched the night between two old street lamps

And every one will touch the night 

Imagine blue dissolve into the empty night
Slowly fading, no one answering
She walked away and left him standing
All alone between the shadows of his memory
And those who loved and lost will know the way it feels
To touch the night without the one you love Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes (whooo)
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou ah-whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Well she walked in the shoe-store, picked out a shoe
She tried on a twelve, but that wouldn't do
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou bought a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou ah-whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Well, she cracked up over the solid fit
Walkin' down the street with her brand new kit
Well, she's walkin' down the street, she met an undertaker
He tried to burry her new shudebakers
Well, she went to a rock 'n' roll party the other night
Someone stepped on her shudebakers and she started a fight!
Well, she walked in the shoe-store, gave the man a tip
She told him to go buy himself a rocketship Old ways
It sure is hard
To change them
Come what may
It's hard to teach
A dinosaur a new trick
Lately I've been finding out
I'm set in my ways
Old ways
Can be your ball
And chain
Oh, I'm going to stop that grass
And give up all this drinking
Really going to make my life last
Clean up my whole way of living
Up until the party last night
I was a different man
But old ways
Got their way again
The economy was getting so bad
I had to lay myself off
Well, working was a habit I had
So I kept showing up anyway
Then one day
Things turned around
I got my back pay
Old ways
Coming through again

I got old ways See somebody
Walking down the street
Hanging head
And a-shuffling feet
Don't take much to see
What they've been thinking of
What makes you hypnotized?
What puts a tear in your eye?
What makes you have to choose?
What brings you the blues?
A little thing called love 

Only love puts a tear in your eye
Only love makes you hypnotized
Only love makes you choose
Only love brings you the blues

Wait a minute now, honey
Don't be sad
This may be the best love you ever had
That don't mean that you had enough
A little thing called love 


A little thing called love  When the morning comes and you’re still sleeping
With all those dreams in your pretty head
I light a fire while the sun comes creeping
All across the meadow bed
The old clock has stopped, no longer ticking
No longer counting every second

Out by the car our snowman's melting
Nothing can bring him back now
His smile a twig and his nose a cucumber
His eyes two pine cones looking out
We got pictures of him like two little kids laughing
In the snow we were walking hand in hand

We went looking for a big surprise
And when we found before our eyes
Two white elks grazing on the green
We heard the honkers coming
Landing on the lakes of summer
Nesting there and waiting for a dream

When the morning comes and you’re still sleeping
With all those dreams in your pretty head
I light a fire and the sun comes creeping
All across the meadow bed When sadness fills your heart
Sorrow hides the longing to be free
When things go wrong each day
You fix your mind to escape your misery
Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death
How strange, your happy words
Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
How tears have filled the eyes
Of friends that you once walked among
Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death
One grain of pure white snow
Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
In peace your mind withdraws
Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain
Your troubled young life
Has made you turn
To the needle of death
Your mother stands a-cryin'
While to the earth your body's slowly cast
Your father stands in silence
Caressing every young dream of the past
And your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death
Through ages, man's desires
To free his mind, to releave his very soul
Has proved to all who live
That death itself is freedom for evermore
And your troubled young life
Had make you turn
To the needle of death
And your troubled young life
Had make you turn
To the needle of death A funny thing happened yesterday
I felt the pressure in a brand new way
It kept hitting me from all directions
I got this feeling
I was cracking up
My knees were shaking and
I couldn't close my eyes
I fought to gain control and make corrections
A funny thing happened yesterday
I felt the pressure in a TV way

Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
No pressure from me
Don't feel, don't feel
Feel pressure from me

You watch the box and the video jocks
If you could talk that could even be you up there
That's why you need max head room
Too much pressure for peace on earth
Too much trying to get your money's worth
Too much dying
The Eldorado, the Mercedes Benz
The job security that never ends


I feel the pressure
Building every night
One of these days I'm gonna
Go out like a light
Oh, baby I feel the pressure
Building every night
One of these days I'm gonna
Go out like a light All through the lonesome night
I tossed and I turned
Lost in these dreams of you
Since the day I learned
How could you give yourself
To another man
A fool for your love 

Look how your eyes have changed
All the love has gone
Where did I lose you babe
What did I do wrong
How could you give yourself
To another man
I'm a fool for your love 
Now you won't say goodbye
But you don't want to stay
I never thought that I
Would lose you this way
A fool for your love


Fool for your love 
I hold on your love
I'm just a fool in love with you
I'm a fool, fool for your love  There's a long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
When you're alone, you cheat yourself
You paint yourself in a dark, dark place
You get your shoes and get your hat
Get out of here, while you still can
There's nothing right that you can say
You keep on talking anyway
And everyone seems to turn on you
There's nothing right that you can ever do

Spirit road
Spirit road
Spirit road
Spirit road

Now you're on that long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you had to find
You're headed home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
You stop to eat, you start to drink
But you don't stop and you don't think
You lost your keys, you're on your knees
You're on your back and looking up in the trees
And the night swirls for a little girl
A speck of dust in the giant world
There's a spirit road that you must find
A long highway in your mind


There's a long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
Don't feed that snake that turns on you
You starve it out, that's what you do
And it makes you lie, it makes you cheat
It steals your shoes and cuts your feet
The snake keeps feeding through the night
You lose your soul without a fight
There's nothing right that you can say
You keep on talking anyway
There's a long highway in your mind
(Spirit road, spirit road)
The spirit road that you must find
(Spirit road)
Peace again, peace again
(Spirit road)
A long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
When you're alone, you cheat yourself
You paint yourself in a dark, dark place
Get your hat, get your shoes
Get out of here while you can still choose In the lonely shack
By the railroad track
I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound
Of the outward bound
Made me a slave
To my wandering ways

And the wayward wind
Is a restless wind
A restless wind
That yearns to wander
And I was born
The next of kin
The next of kin
To the wayward wind

Oh, I met him down
In the border town
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best
To settle down
Now I'm all alone
With a broken heart
 

The next of kin
To the wayward wind Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one You can play my guitar
See it where it will go
Send this song to a distant star
While the rhythm explodes
Just singing a song won't change the world

You can ride in my car
See how it rolls
Feel the new energy
As it quietly rolls
Just singing a song won't change the world
You can sing about change
While you're making your own
You can be what you try to say
While the big wheel rolls
Just singing a song won't change the world Why art thou silent & invisible
Father of jealousy
Why dost thou hide thyself in clouds
From every searching Eye
Why darkness & obscurity
In all thy words & laws
That none dare eat the fruit but from
The wily serpents jaws
Or is it because Secresy
Gains females loud applause Wish you told me by and by
That my life would come to this
That i'd have to find a way
To let things go
That my friends would turn to foes
And my love would come to blows
Then i would have done some things
Differently
Differently...
I would ask you out every night
Differently...
And i would make you feel so good
Differently...
And appreciate the things that
You bring to me, babe
Differently...
Oh yes i would, oh yeah
Yeah, i know you tried and tried
But your signal i just missed
When you said my little girl
Would soon be gone
Yes i didn't hear you then
And it might be too late now
That's another thing i'd do
Differently
Differently...
Like trying to make you feel
Loved every day
Differently...
And saying little things to
Let you know how i feel
Differently...
Yes i can hear your young
Voice calling me, babe
Differently...
Oh yes i can
When you're away you call you up
And you don't seem to miss me as much
But i know our love
Is still there in your heart
It's just differently
Differently...
Oh yes, i can hear your young
Voice calling me, babe
Differently...
Oh yes i can
Differently...
I'd appreciate the things that you
Bring to me babe, yes i would
Differently...
Oh come on back to me babe
Bring your love back to me
Differently...
Oh yeah i need your love
I need your love
Differently...
Yes i can tell you babe
I need your love
Differently...
Today is a brand new day, yes it is
Differently...
Got to get your love back, babe
Come on now bring it back to me
Differently...
Turn it around babe, turn it
Around and bring it back
Differently...
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, got to get
Your love back, come on babe
Differently...
Yeah i can hear your young
Voice calling me babe
Differently...
Come on back to me, come on back
Yeah yeah, turn it around
Differently...
Oh yes i can, yes i can
Differently When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outa you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost
I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough I'm not the same man
I was a while ago
I've learned some new things
I hope that it shows
I'm free to give my love
But you're not the one
I'm thinking of
So for me
The wheels are turning
Got to keep
The homefires burning
I'll walk these borders
In search of a line
Between young lovers
Who live separate lives

How long can this go on?
I can hear another song
Late at night when I've been drinking
Substitute comes at me winking

I'm not the same man
I was a while ago
I've learned some new things
I hope that it shows
I'm free to give my love
But you're not the one
I'm thinking of Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying, I'm crazy for crying
I'm crazy for loving you
I'm crazy for crying, I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for loving you I'm just a passenger on this old freight train
I ride the boxcar through the night
I doesn't matter where I might get off
I doesn't matter where I lie

I've been to cities, I've been to countries
I've left a lover in many towns
I don't care if I ever get back to
Where I'd already been around
I'm like an eagle, I like to fly high
I'm like a snake, I like to lay low
I'm like a black man, I'm like a white man
Maybe a red man, I don't know Johnny Magic has a way with metal
Has a way with machines
One day in a garage far away
He met destiny
In the form of a heavy metal Continental
She was born to run on a Proud Highway
Then the whole world started running out of money
People losing their jobs
Right here in Wichita

Wichita
The home of the heavy metal Continental
Where the Motor-Head Messiah was tuning the system in
Johnny Magic, Johnny Magic
Johnny Magic, Johnny Magic

She burst from the garage in a blaze of silence
Disappearing down Douglas at lightning speed
She was gone before the garage door was down


Wichita
The home of the heavy metal Continental
She was born to run on a Proud Highway
Now she goes long range on domestic green fuel
100 miles per gallon is the Continental Rule
Out on the Kansas two-lane flats near Wichita


The Motor-Head Messiah went to Washington
To show them what he'd done
The senators and congressmen came down
In Washington
And they rode in the heavy metal Continental
She was born to run on a Proud Highway
Johnny Magic, Johnny Magic 
Wichita
The Motor-Head Messiah was tuning the system in
Wichita (repeats until fade) Somewhere in the rays of sunshine, you find the dark
Somehow when you see the spark, it burns your heart
Someone's gonna rescue you and bring you back
I see you standing there, I hear you call
And when you look at me, you don't see it all
Someone's gonna rescue you before you fall
No one can do the things you do
Someone can save you
You're scared of the way it goes sometimes in the night
When it gets the best of you, you put up a fight
Someone's gonna rescue you and make it right
Someone's gonna rescue you This one's for you Al Freed
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Because the things they're doing today
Will make a saint out of you
Payola blues
I've got the payola blues
Even though I already paid my dues
Listen to me Mr. D.J
Hear what I've got to say
If a man is making music
They ought to let his record play

Payola blues
No matter where I go
I never hear my record on the radio

Well, here's three thousand
That ought to get it on
Well, thanks a lot man!
I love your new song


I got a brand new record company
New manager too
Got a great new record
I can't get through to you


How about this new Mercedes Benz
That ought to get it on
Well, thanks a lot man!
I'll play it all day long


I've got the payola blues, payola blues
I'm paying those payola blues
No matter where I go
I never hear my record on the radio I'm just a believer, babe
And those dreams of mine
You see, they just keep on coming
In a long, long line
Oh yeah, I'm a believer
Like that songbird singing
Whether it's red or blue
Just like those church bells ringing
I'm keeping my faith in you

(I believe in you)
Oh yeah, I'm a believer
(I believe in you)
Oh yeah, I believe in you

And though the seas may rise
Until they do
I keep doing the things I'm doing
And believe in you
I'm making the change
I'm keeping my faith in you


Sure is a windy road
That I walk with you
Look how the trees are bending
Their leaves are falling too


I remember my mama saying
I want to be
On this windy road
For eternity
I'm making the change
I'm keeping my faith in you


Oh yeah, I'm the believer
Oh yeah Do you know how to use this weapon?
- Not really. - That weapon will replace your tongue
You will learn to speak through it
And your poetry will now be written with blood
What is your name?
My name is Nobody
- Excuse me? - My name is Exaybachay:
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing
He Who Talks--
I thought you said your name was Nobody
I prefer to be called Nobody I used to carry the weight of the world
On my back
I never trusted my friends or my girl
Can you imagine that
I used to shuffle my feet
When I walked
I hung my head down low
Kept to myself all my private thoughts
But when I met you girl

I dropped the weight of the world
Weight of the world
I dropped the weight of the world
Weight of the world

I knew some people used to dance all night
But not me
I never knew if it was wrong or right
To be so free
I used to close my eyes
And try to hide from the light of love
Spent all my time with the darkness inside
But when I met you girl


I was alone for all of my life 
Until you came my way Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home
You got me cryin'
'Bout to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once again
Spoken:
Honey, I need your love
Darlin', you know why
If you would come back home
There'll be no need for me to cry
Sings:
Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home I feel the rumbling in her ground
I feel the rumbling
I feel the rumbling in her ground
I feel the rumbling

When will I learn how to listen?
When will I learn how to feel?
When will I learn how to give back?
When will I learn how to heal?
I can feel the weather changing
I can see it all around, all around
Can't you feel that new wind blowing?
Don't you recognize that sound that sound, that sound?
And the earth is slowly spinning, spinning slowly, slowly changing
I feel something in the air


When will I learn?
When will I learn how to give back?
When will I learn how to heal? I got a problem
I can't explain
It's hard to solve it
I can't lose face
They all try to help me
But I can't see the light

Me and my shadow are so in despair
Because we keep hurting someone who cares
Every time we talk about it
I break out in a cold sweat
There must be some way out of here
But I can't find it yet

I got a problem
That's so intense
I try to fight it
But there's no defense

Every time we talk about it
I break out in a cold sweat
There must be some way out of here
But I can't find it yet

I got a problem 
Every time we talk about it
I break out in a cold sweat When you try to bring our spirit home
Won't you celebrate our lives
In a way that's right for our children
And families
When you write your songs about us
Won't you try to do us justice
Because we want to be just like you
And your families
I see a light ahead
There's a chill wind blowing in my head
I wish that I was home instead
With my family
There's a universe between us now
But I want to reach our and tell you how
Much you mean to me
And my family
I'm going back to the USA
I just got my ticket today
I can't wait to see you again
In the USA It is not the truth
It is not the truth, now, baby
It is not the truth, now
What I say?

Eat watermelon
Eat peaches and cream
Eat ripe tomatoes
You know what I mean


Your majesty
Your curvaceousness
Your highness
Your soulfulness

Make love to me, babe
Make love to me
Make me feel all right, now
Make me feel so good Here comes the night
Here comes the anger
Hidden so deep inside
No one can see
Behind these eyes
There walks a stranger
Wandering through the dark
Following me

Control the violent side 

Electric light
Shining on your block
Saying to everyone
The power is on
While your alarm
Set up for safety
Keeps out invaders who come
But still can't control


Got to fight to control
The violent side
Every day and night
I've got to fight
To control it My blood is mixed
My mother was ungumpai picani, my father was habsoluca
This mixture was not respected; as a small boy I was often left to myself
So I spent many months stalking the Elk people, to prove i would soon become a good hunter
One day finally, my Elk relatives took pity on me, and a young Elk gave his life to me
With only my knife, I took his life
As I was preparing to cut the meat white men came upon me, they were English soldiers
I cut one with my knife but they hit me on the head, with a rifle
All went black; my spirit seemed to leave me
I was then taken east, in a cage
I was taken to Toronto, then Philadelphia, and then to New York; and each time I arrived in another city, somehow the white man had moved all thier people there ahead of me
Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I could not understand how a whole city of people could be moved so quickly
Eventually, I was taken on a ship across the great sea, over to England, and I was paraded before them like a captured animal, an exhibit
So I mimicked them, imitating their ways, hoping they might lose interest in this young savage, but their interest only grew
I was copying them so they placed me into the white mans school
It was there that I discovered, in a book, the words that William Blake had written
They were powerful words and they spoke to me
So I made careful plans and eventually I escaped
Once again I crossed the great ocean
I saw many sad things as I made my way back to the lands of my people
Once they realized who I was, the stories of my adventures angered them
They called me a liar
Xebachae-he who talks loud saying nothing
Ridiculed by my own people, and I was left to wander the earth alone
I am Nobody Are there any more
Real cowboys
Left out in these hills?
Will the fire hit the iron
One more time?
And will one more
Dusty pick-up
Coming rolling down the road
With a load of feed
Before the sun gets high?
Well, I hope that
Working cowboy never dies
Not the one
That's snorting cocaine
When the honky-tonks all closed
But the one
That prays for more rain
Heaven knows
That the good feed
Brings the money
And the money buys the clothes
Not the diamond sequins
Shining on TV
But the kind the
Working cowboy really needs
Are there any more
Country families
Still working hand in hand
Trying hard to stay together
And make a stand?
While the rows and rows of houses
Come creeping up on the land
Where the cattle graze and
An old grey barn still stands
Are there any more
Real cowboys in this land?

Are there any more
Real cowboys in this land? Well, I went with Mary Lou
Tried Peggy Sue
Had a date with Donna
And Barbara Ann too

But I'm kind of found of Want to
Kind of found of Want to
Yeah, I'm kind of found of Want to
Because Want to always
Want to want to want to

Well, I went out with Jenny
Took out skinny Minnie
Long tall Sally
And short fat Fanny


Did the bop with Miss Ann
The swim with Mary Ann
The stroll with Betty Lou
Screwed runaround Sue
But she wasn't
As good as Want to
No, she'll never be
As good as Want to
I'm kind of found of Want to
Because Want to always
Want to want to want to

Kind of found of Want to
Yeah, I'm kind of found of Want to
Because Wanda always
Want to want to want to The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've got the way
We'll lead the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong
The way, we know the way
We've got the way, we'll share the way
To bring you back home
To the peace where you belong

So many lost highways used to lead home
But now they seem used up and gone
They sure had the magic when they were first found
But not this road, this road has never been closed
It's still brand new

The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To bring you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've got the way
We'll lead the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, we know the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong

When faceless and anonymous
Come to beat down your door
And say you're all washed up and done
You can just say they have nothing
In store to touch this soul
Because they just don't know
They just don't know the way

The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
The way, we got the way
We know the way, we'll lead the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong
If you're lost and think you can't be found
We know the way, we've found the way
We'll share the way to get you back home
To the peace where you belong

The way, we know the way
We've seen the way, we'll show the way
To get you back home
To the peace where you belong Have you heard the news
I lost my baby to another man
I got a bulletin of news
Late breaking story that I don't understand
Should I call her up late
Should I ask her how she really feels
Should I try to make a date
For a time when we can touch
And feel

She' so on fire
She's my desire

I've got the bad news beat
And my reception is loud and clear
I've got a man in the street
Telling me what
I don't want to hear
I've got an eye in the sky
Taking pictures that
I don't want to see
She's got a brand new guy
Looks like she's never coming back
To me


I've got an eye in the sky
I've got a man in the street
I've got the bad news beat
I've got the bad news beat If you're looking for me
You'll find me
Resting in the shade
Of the mountains and trees
Beneath the cool summer breeze
And I don't mind if you stay

Everybody's alone

People talking to me
Someone saying
That I'm not the same
That's not so easy to be
But when I'll learn to be free
I wonder if I'll miss the pain


All I want you to know
Is that I love you so much
I can hardly stand it
When everybody's alone One day a visitor took a trip through my town
We all were dancing till he took his beat away
Come to think of it, he thought of every last detail
Slipped out late one night
Completely out of sight
Left his message etched into my brain
And when the gates are closed on the road of plenty
The fist comes pounding down you feel it everyday
It's hard to really know if you are full or empty
Here it comes again
You think I'm your old friend
But now we're not so easily found
Me and my old corvette, we were flying through the night
Chasing my blonde lover down skyline
She saw the tail lights flash to avoid the crash
It was way too late
When I hit the brakes
And we went spinning with a screeching sound
I was talking to my friend, telling him I lucked out
He smiled at me and said I'm glad you feel that way
And when I wrote that down on a piece of paper
Beneath a garbage heap
Down upon the street
A mariachi band began to play
Up in the gold hotel, the money hits the table
The heavies are all there, that's why the deal goes down
With beautiful women all dressed in diamonds and sable
Down upon the street
Beside a garbage heap
A mariachi band began to play
In Eldorado town there lives a great bullfighter
His eyes are screaming blue, his hair is red as blood
And when the gate goes up, the crowd gets so excited
Then he comes dancing out
Dressed in gold lami
He kills the bull and lives another day Down on the coastline, Highway One
People heading out for the sun
That's where I found you long time ago
You're my angel, you're my queen
You're my best friend in between

We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning

Oowee, baby, what a night
That old moon sure is shining bright
We'll be dancing till the morning comes
High on the mountain top
Above the clouds
No wonder we get a little loud

We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning


We don't back down from no trouble
We do get up in the morning Young Pegi just died today
Young Pegi just died today
And I guess nobody even knows the case
But the way the story goes
She just ran out of clothes
No will this world
Just for the peg down
Last words, can't talk
And then she wrote
Some people can't stand no rain
Some people can't stand no rain
When it's cloudy outside
You can't see the sun
But on a bright and sunny day
The people all go away
Except one
Oh no don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
Don't see no tears around me
Don't see no tears around me
I don't take too much stock
In the things people say
I'm not saying that they're wrong
They've just been standing around too long
Gone bad
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
Can't ride my broom no more
Can't ride my broom no more
'Cause the landlady's taken
To sweeping the floor
I guess I'll go back to my place
And occupy a little space
John Doe
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
The streets are crammed, can't walk
Might find somebody and talk
I can't find nobody who
Say boo, guess who
'Cause that street is paved with aires
And everybody is putting on theirs
Can't breathe
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
He's standing outside my door
He's standing outside my door
But he won't ring the bell
And he's just to scared to knock
And he's puzzled
And he's young
And he's doing what's already been done
One more
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright All the champs and the heroes
They got a price to pay
They go from sixty to zero
In the split of a hair
They see the face in the window
They feel a shadow out there
They've got the places they can go
They've got the people who stare
They've got to walk in their shoes
They've got to see what they see
They've got the people around them
Getting too much for free
All the pimps and the dealers
All the food they can eat
All the screamers and squealers
When they walk down the street
Yeah
He's just a rich old man
He never cared for anyone
He likes to count his possessions
He's been a miser from penny one
He never cared for his children
Never cared for his wife
Never made anyone happy
That's the way he lived his life
And one day in the sunshine
He got a bolt from the blue
Unloaded all of his possessions
Sold his investments too
And now he lives with the homeless
Owns 900 hospital beds
He prefers to remain nameless
It's publicity he dreads
Yeah
There's a judge in the city
He goes to work every day
Spends his life in the courthouse
Keeps his perspective that way
But I respect his decision
He's got a lot on his mind
He's pretty good with the gavel
A little heavy on the fines
One day there was this minstrel
Who came to court on a charge
That he blew someone's head off
Because his amp was too large
And the song he was singing
Was not for love but for cash
Well, the judge waived the charges
He fingered his mustache
Yeah
Well, there's a clown in a carnival
He rode a painted horse
He came from somewhere out west
He was very funny of course
But that is not what I noticed
It was the incredible force
With which he held his audience
While he rode on his horse
His jokes were not that off-color
His smile was not that sincere
His show was that not that sensational
Reasons for success were not clear
But he still made big money
One day the circus was his
Now he's married to the acrobat
And they're training their kids
Yeah
Now the jailhouse was empty
All the criminals were gone
The gate was left wide open
And a buck and fawn
Were eating grass in the courtyard
When the warden walked in
And took a rifle from the prison guard
And said to him with a grin
To shoot those deer would be stupid, sir
We already got them right here
Why not just lock the gates and keep them
With intimidation and fear?
But the warden pulled the trigger
And those deer hit the ground
He said nobody'll know the difference
And they both looked around
Yeah
Well, the cop made the showdown
He was sure he was right
He had all of the lowdown
From the bank heist last night
His best friend was a robber
And his wife was a thief
All the children were murderers
They couldn't get no relief
The bungalow was surrounded
When a voice loud and clear
Come out with your hands up
Or we're going to blow you out of here
There was a face in the window
Tv cameras rolled
And they cut to the announcer
And the story was told
Yeah
Well, the artist looked at the producer
The producer sat back
He said what we have got here
Is a pretty good track
But we don't have a vocal
And we still don't have a song
If we could get this thing accomplished
Nothing else could go wrong
So he balanced the ashtray
And he picked up the phone
And said send me a songwriter
Who's drifted far from home
And make sure that he's hungry
And make sure he's alone
And send me a cheeseburger
And a new rolling stone
Yeah
Well, the sioux and dakota
They lost all of their land
And now a basketball player
Is trying to lend them a hand
Maybe someday he'll be president
He's quite a popular man
But now the chief has reservations
And the white man has plans
There's opposition in congress
The bill is up against cash
There's really no way of predicting
If it will fly or it will crash
But that's the nature of politics
That's the name of the game
That's how it looks in the tepee
Big winds are blowing again
Yeah
There's still crime in the city
Said the cop on the beat
I don't know if I can stop it
I feel like meat on the street
They paint my car like a target
I take my orders from fools
Meanwhile some kid blows my head off
Well, I play by their rules
So now I'm doing it my way
I took the law in my own hands
Here I am in the alleyway
A wad of cash in my pants
I get paid by a ten year old
He says he looks up to me
There's still crime in the city
But it's good to be free
Yeah
Now I come from a family
That has a broken home
Sometimes I talk to my daddy
On the telephone
When he says that he loves me
I know that he does
But I wish I could see him
Wish I knew where he was
But that's the way all my friends are
Except maybe one or two
Wish I could see him this weekend
Wish I could walk in his shoes
But now I'm doing my own thing
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
Although my home has been broken
It's the best home I ever had
Yeah
Well, I keep getting younger
My life's been funny that way
Before I ever learned to talk
I forgot what to say
I sassed back to my mummy
I sassed back to my teacher
I got thrown out of sunday school
For throwing bibles at the preacher
Then I grew up to be a fireman
I put out every fire in town
Put out everything smoking
But when I put the hose down
The judge sent me to prison
Gave me life without parole
Wish I never put the hose down
Wish I never got old When the blues moved north to Chicago they came
And I caught some myself in this blind alley and rain
Close to the L with its clattering train
Near an old ornate theater where I soon will be playing
I soon will be playing

So I said hello for you, when I saw a stylish girl
Walking by on the sidewalk with her hair in a swirl
From the wind that was growing at the end of the day
And I wondered what would be coming my way
What would be coming my way
Coming my way

You know I been to Chicago, I was here once before
And the rain kept on pounding outside the stage door
I was singing and drinking with love in my heart
I was younger and stronger while life played it’s part
While life played it’s part
Life played it’s part
Life played it’s part

Let us not be strangers if we come to know
Things about each other that seem to come go
‘Cause friendship is everything if love is to last
And I have my guard down and love passes fast
Love passes fast
Love passes fast
Love passes fast

Say hello to Chicago
Say hello to Chicago
Say hello to Chicago
Say hello to Chicago  (Conversation between 'Scary' Gary Davis and Neil Young)

Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry

Well, old man river just keeps on rolling
On down the line
Like my tears just keep on flowing
All the time
Can't you hear me cry


Well, somewhere there's a rainbow for me
I know it's my time
I am getting so tired
Of standing in this light
Can't you hear me cry

Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, boo, hoo
Boo, hoo, hoo, cry, cry, cry
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo
Cry, cry, cry, cry When I’m riding down the road in my car travelin' without you
I can still see you sittin’ there, right by my side
With the headlights of the oncoming cars flashin' in the windshield
There’s a glimmer of everything that I once saw in you

Tough love can leave you almost alone
But new love brings back everything to you
All the feelings in your heart come re-awakened

Like a forest without leaves on it’s trees standing in the desert
Like the light that still leaks through when you close the door
Like the changes in our life that hits so hard that day I couldn’t find you
There’s a glimmer of everything good that once came before

Tough love can leave you almost alone
But new love brings back everything to you
All the feelings in your heart come reawakened

And there’s a glimmer of everything good that once came before
There’s still a glimmer of everything that I first saw in you When you hear that rooster crowing
In the dawn, in the dawn
There's really no way of knowing
What goes on, what goes on
The world is full of questions
Some are answered, some are not
The only faith you're keeping
Is the faith that you still got
I love the sound of laughter
And music in the air
And in the ever after
I know it's always there
A man had many boxes
And he liked them quite a lot
But they would not be opened
Because the value would be shot
Sometimes when I go walking
In the trees, in the trees
That's where I do my praying
In the trees, in the trees
The world is full of answers
Some are right, some are wrong
The one that I believe in
Is a wish in a song

I love to see you smiling
And hear your voice so fair
And in the ever after
I know you're always there Someday you’ll want me
Someday you're gonna get back there
Someday you’ll see me, like you used to do

I got my problems
But they mostly show up with you
Someday you’ll see me, like you used to do

I couldn’t satisfy you
Just couldn’t show you my love
But I kept on trying
Yeah, I tried and I tried
And as the time went by
You just didn’t want it no more


Yeah, some day you’ll want me
Someday you’re gonna get back there
Someday you’re gonna need me, like you used to do There isn't no way
I'm going to let the good times go
There isn't no way
I'm going to let the good times go
The touch of my woman
Can soothe my soul
When she makes me feel right
That's when the good times roll

Oh she's a healer to me
Oh yeah

My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me
The touch of my woman
Can soothe my soul
When she makes me feel right
That's when the good times roll


Way out on the prairie
Where the wheat fields grow
Way out on the prairie
Back where the wheat fields grow
I stop to slap plastic at an Esso station
About a thousand miles from my destination


All I got is a broken heart
And I don't try to hide it
When I play my guitar

My blue-eyed woman is a healer to me
Without that woman I'm history
My blue-eyed woman is a love ghost
Without that woman I'm toast


All I got is a broken heart
And I don't try to hide it
When I play my guitar Day and night we walk these aisles
In the same old movie show
And look for someone
To feel for a while
There's matinees on Saturdays
When we sit in the velvet chairs
Popcorn boxes fly through the air

Sad movies, they make you cry
Sad movies make you wonder why
You ever came
Do something to me
Don't make me wait
Stab something through me
Don't cry out the good things
That I appreciate

Day and night we walk these aisles
In the same old movie show
And look for someone
To feel for a while
The light's go on, the movie's gone
And the manager's up there
He says he doesn't care
And we take our money back

Sad movies, they make you cry
Sad movies make you wonder why
You ever came On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
I just can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things I may never see again
And I just can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world be turnin' our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
Life I love is makin' music with my friends
I just can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin' places that I never see again
Seein' things I never see again
Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway
I just can't wait to get on the road again I would be feeling so low
She'd have a new place to go
She'd take me in her arms
And show me all her charms
Until my troubles were gone

Then when I left her behind
Never a tear could I find
Just a haunting melody
Coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?

Where is the highway tonight?
Where are those old days
And crazy nights?

Now the house is
All quiet and still
Coyote howls on the hill
How far did I go
Before we said hello
Where is the highway tonight?
Darling, you'll always be mine
I'll never treat you unkind
But a haunting melody
Keeps coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?


A haunting melody
Keeps coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight? When grandma and grandpa
Get out on the floor
They rock until they drop
And then they rock some more

Yeah, everybody's rocking
Well, everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Rocking to the dancing beat

From the shakey city
Down to New Orleans
The Golden Gate
To the Bronx and Queens


When Ronnie and Nancy
Do the bop on the lawn
They're rocking in the White House
All night long


Everybody's rocking
Rocking their blues away
Everybody's rocking
Rockin' all night and day

Everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Yeah, everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Everybody's rocking
Rocking to the dancing beat
Everybody's rocking
Dancing to the rocking beat Taking a trip across the USA
Gonna meet a lot of people along the way
From far and Wide
Floating along on the Rio Grande
Coca Cola in my hand
In the promise Land
Living my days in the old jail cell
Somehow life just goes to hell
With one bad hand

Love is love
Hate is hate
Now is now
And late it late
Truth is fiction
Truth is lies
Strange things happen
When worlds collide
Strange things happen
When worlds collide

Cruising down Route 66
Where the guys and gals
Used to get their kicks
In the old days
Running low on the people's fuel
Riding in something that's really cool
On the proud highway
Living my days in an old jail cell
Somehow things just go to hell
When worlds collide

Black is black
White is white
Wrong is wrong
And wrong is right
Truth is fiction
Truth is lies
Strange things happen
When worlds collide
Strange things happen
When worlds collide


Strange things happen I'm just a drifter
I'll stay until you try to tie me down
I'm not a quitter, baby
I'd like to stay and see the whole thing go down

Don't try to tell me
What I gotta do to fit
Don't try to rescue me
I'm going to go with my ship

What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?
I like to drive my car
If I've got someplace to go
I like to feel the wheel
Put down the top and let it roll

Don't try to fence me in
Don't try to slow me down
Don't try to speed me up
Or tie my feet down to the ground

What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?

I'm just a drifter
I'll stay until you try to tie me down
Don't try to rescue me 
I like to feel the wheel  Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It looks like the sun
But it feels like the moon

Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon

Who lives in an old hotel
Near the ancient ruins
Only time can tell
Time can tell
Go easy, the doorman said
The floor is slippery
So watch your head
This message read If you wake up in the morning light
Something doesn't seem
Or know is right
Lay back and let your feeling show
Come on and let the people know

Oh, that's the price that you pay
Oh, that's the price that you pay

Just, money
Your baby
Now come on boys


Bad news is just an excuse
Get down and
Let yourself keep loose
Go on and live for tomorrow
So much spent today in sorrow I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say, son, take a good look around
This is your hometown
Your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
In '65, tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights between blacks and whites, there was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night, in the backseat there was a gun
Words were passed, in a shotgun blast troubled times had come
To my hometown
My hometown
My hometown
My hometown
Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says, these jobs are going, boys, and they ain't coming back
To your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Last night me and Kate, laid in bed, talking about getting out
Packing up our bags, and maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now
Last night, I sat him up behind the wheel and said, son, take a good look around
This is your hometown Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
I'd tried to tell the woman
But she doesn't believe a word I said
Go light pretty baby...
Gonna need my help some day
It's all right pretty baby...
Gonna need my help some day
You're gonna wish you listened
To some of those things I said
Go ahead pretty baby
Oh, honey knock yourself out
Go ahead pretty baby
Oh honey knock yourself out
I still love you baby
Cause you don't know what it's all about
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again)
Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down the line
Well it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
(she's mine, all, all mine) In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go
Out on runway number nine a 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here in the ground where the cold wind blows
And the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Yeah, there she goes, my friend, she's be going down at last
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
There the morning rain don't fall where the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain (Cough up the bucks)

Where did all the money go
Where did all the cash flow
Where did all the money go


(Cough up the bucks)
It's all about my car (Cough up the bucks)
And my girl
It's all about my world, my world


Where did all the money go
Where did all the cash flow
Where did all the revenue stay


(Cough up the bucks)
It's all about my girl (Cough up the bucks)
And my dream
It's all about my world, my world You can't help nobody
Until you help yourself
You can't help nobody
Until you help yourself
Nobody's going to help you
Better than somebody else

You know a man needs a woman
Right by his side
A man needs a woman
Right by his side
She keeps him warm at night
He keeps her satisfied

Soul of a woman, soul of a man
A perfect combination
Ever since the world began
Soul of a woman
Soul of a woman, soul of a man If I listen long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing, that you lied, straight-faced
While I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without, somebody else
Someone like you, makes it easy to give
Never thinking of myself
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing how you lied, straight-faced
Well I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without, somebody else If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see
If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sells
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
The feelin's gone and I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back Many moons ago in the future
When the womenfolk had rightfully just about given up on us
A {?} group of outlaws hid out by a precious water source
While the real bad guide quietly stole the seas of life
Thankfully music still helped our spirits fly Leaders walk among us
And I hope they hear our call
Maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all
Lookin' for a leader
To bring our country home
Reunite the red white and blue
Before it turns to stone
Lookin' for somebody
With the strength to take it on
Keep us safe together
And make this country strong
Walkin' among our people
There's someone to lead us on
Need a rainbow of colors
In a broken world gone wrong
Yeah we had Barack Obama
And we really need him now
The man who stood behind him
Has to take his place somehow
America has a leader
Buildin' walls around our house
Who don't know black lives matter
And we got to vote him out
We got our election
But corruption has a chance
We got to have a big win
To regain confidence
America is beautiful
But she has an ugly side
We're lookin' for a leader
In this country far and wide
Just like his big new fence
This president's going down
America's moving forward
You can feel it in every town
Scared of his own shadow
Buildin' walls around our house
He's hiding in his bunker
Something else to lie about
We don't need a leader
Building walls around our house
Who don't know black lives matter
And it's time to vote him out
We're lookin' for a leader
With the great spirit on his side
Lookin' for a leader
In this country far and wide
We're lookin' for a leader
With the great spirit on his side When I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just drive on through
You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
Smoked through a pen and I'll do it again
If I only had some cash
Only had some cash
Then I tried amphetamines
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my 48 Buick's dash
But I knew that wouldn't last
Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter
But the neon lights
And the endless nights
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes
Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen
Living in the country
Sounded good to me
Smoking grass with my Chicago lass
In a real organic scene
Where everything was green
We had a kid and we split apart
Now I'm living on the road
And a little cocaine goes a long, long way
To ease that different load
But that ain't all that I know
My head did explode
I wish I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru Well, I came home late one night
And much to my surprise
I was thrown
Right across the kitchen floor
She hit me right between the eyes


I was out with a friend of mine
We were feeling mighty fine
And we sure was moving fast
And I didn't make it back on time


I had a big tall red
With one of my friends
He was feeling mighty fine
When I came home late that night
She hit me right between the eyes


So if you find yourself
In a party mood
Let your conscience be your guide
Don't be like me and let lefty win
Or you'll find yourself outside

Living in the doghouse, doghouse
Doghouse, doghouse
Doghouse, doghouse Good looking Milly's got a gun in her hand
But she don't know how to use it
Sooner or later she'll have to take a stand
And she isn't about to lose it
All the towns people gather around
They've come to see what's going down

Although no one hears a sound
There's another poor man falling down
Falling down, falling down

On this lazy shore
Standing at the edge of you
Could those dreams of yours be true
Or did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end?
How much time did you spend?
Pushed it over the end
Good looking Milly's into politics now
And things are looking much better
She keeps ten men in her garage
Knitting her fine sweaters
At the end of a weary day
She feels hard and she looks hard


I came back for more
And found you waiting at the door
And far inside your walls I called
Did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end?
How much time did you spend?
Pushed it over the end
How much love did you spend?
Pushed it over the end Don't tell me hard luck stories, and I won't tell you mine 

Every time you're feeling fine
Got another good one on the line
It slips away
You feel it slip away, slip away
I don't want no more from you
Won't do what you want me to
Turn me loose
Come on turn me loose
Turn me loose
Every time I'm feeling good
The phone rings
And I knock on wood
Hoping that it won't be you
Calling like you always do
All you ever seem to say is
How much bad luck came your way
You won't try to start again
You just count on your old friends


Now you call up every day
Got no money no place to stay
That girl made a mess of you
You got what was coming too
Build her up and let her down
Tasting everything in town
Treat her right, you never
Treat her right, treat her right
Now she's gone and you're alone
Bite your fingers to the bone
Slip away
You feel it slip away, slip away
You don't know what's going on
How you lost it, what went wrong
What ever happened to
The love that you once knew Well, hello lonely woman
Won't you take a walk with me
I know a place where we can go
Grab a bite to eat
Hello lonely woman
Are you feeling all right?
Well, you look just like heaven
On a clear clear night
Well, I know you're a lonely woman
And I know what's on your mind
I won't ask you any question
I'm familiar with your kind
I know you need me
Like a river needs rain
I won't ask you any favors
Until I pass this way again Well, if you've got the craving
For some jellyroll
You've got to have it right now
Well, if you've got the craving
For some jellyroll
You've got to have it right now
I'm your jellyroll man
I've got to have it right now

I'm your jellyroll man
I've got to have it right now When I think about love
Honey, you always
Come across my mind
Is it the way that you hold me
Or the way that
You told me love is blind
Well, it's a crime of the heart
These things I'm
Thinking to myself
But I can't forget you, babe
Just can't seem to
Think of nothing else
Got a woman at home
A family to feed
Three fine children
They think the Lord of me
Now I'm standing
At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love
Well, I heard that song
Says girls just wanna have fun
Well, I guess I
Bought my ticket, honey
'Cause it feels as if
The ride has just begun
Well, there's two kinds of love
One is wrong and one is right
But I can't forget you baby
Can't forget
The way you hold me tight
I got a woman at home
A family to feed
Three fine children
They think the Lord of me
Well, I'm standing
At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love
When I think about women
Honey, you always
Come across my mind
Is it the way that you told me
The way you told me love is blind
Well, it's a crime of the heart
These things I'm
Thinking to myself now
Can't forget you, babe
Can't forget
The way you make me feel
I got a woman at home
A family to feed
Three fine children
At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love  Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
And my friends all tell me that I am not the same
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
Well, I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby all I need is you
Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
Yeah, since I met you baby I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can When the day is done
And the sun is sinking low
When you've see the light
When you've been most everywhere

You go
When the traffic's slow
Break lines lined up for miles and miles

And you know the end is not in sight
You can never take your eyes
Off the road

When you're all alone
And you've been driving through the night Well I hate to say the farmer
Was the last of a dying breed
Living off the land
And taking what he needs
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind
In the struggle for parity
Not one man's voice can sound
Cause the foundation of the conglomerate
Is firmly in the ground
Yeah, they want to feed the world
But for power and for greed
Then they'll cut off the supply
Until they get what they need
Well I dreamed I saw a dust bowl
Where the farmers used to live
Earth was flying through the sky
It had nothing left to give
Tractors were burning
On the Whitehouse lawn
Just woke up one morning
And the farmers all were gone
I hate to say the farmer
Was the last of a dying breed
Living off the land
And taking what he needs
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind Welcome to the big room
Everything's alright
People, welcome to the big room
Because everything's alright
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

Don't have no cameras in the big room
Too much for one lens to see
Don't allow no cameras in the big room
Too much for one lens to see
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright

There's always tellers in the big room
Every day and every night
There's always tellers in the big room
Every day and every night

There's always dancing in the big room
Every day and every night

Leave your troubles at the door
People, welcome to the big room
Leave your troubles at the door
It's alright
It's alright, It's alright You know she needs attention
So take her for a ride
(You gotta get behind the wheel) She loves to go around anywhere
(In the morning and drive) Anytime that you decide

(You gotta get behind the wheel) In the morning and drive
You gotta get behind the wheel

You know she loves those long slow curves
So take her for a spin
(You gotta get behind the wheel) She always wants to please you
(In the morning and drive) No matter what shape your in


You know she takes a little care
She's always looking good
(You gotta get behind the wheel) Pull over and put the top down
(In the morning and drive) Check out what's under the hood Try to find
The perfect time
To say something to you
Filled with meaning
Filled with truth
If I could just live my life
As easy as a song
I'd wake up someday
And the pain will all be gone
Help me now I'm sinking fast
I gotta get along
To the Gateway of Love
Gateway Of Love
Background noise
On a changing sky
You'll be making love to me
I still feel you
In my heart's eye
But I'm just a dusty soul
With nothing much to say
Down here in the hay
Bound to stay that way
I've got almost everything
Except that little key
To the Gateway of Love
Gateway of Love
Some will say
Theres a place on high
Where angels rip their wings
And babys learn to fly
Some will say
There's a place on high
But I'd like to stay down here
Try to love someone
Here in this life
Where we watch the bouncing sun
I'd just like to hold her hair
And bring her back to me
At the Gateway of Love
Gateway of Love Her engine's running and the fuel is clean
She only uses it cause she's a machine
She don't use much though, just to get around

(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)

The awesome power of electricity
Stored for you in a massive battery
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car


Fill her up!

The world is ready for a whole new game
Some old-timers wanna stay the same
They like to advertise how clean and green they are


But she don't listen to what they say
She burned the mess they clean(?) instead
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car



She's not the car that she used to be
Keep ready for you, and she's ready for me
Into the future that's her destiny I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day
And wondered why I had to pay
The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if I'll suffer more
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
My pride is made to say forgive
And take the blame for what you did
It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of
I wonder if I'm still in love
My heart can't thrive on misery
My life it has no destiny
When things get more
Than I can bear
I ask myself ""Do I still care?""
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before I won't apologize
The light shone from in your eyes
It isn't gone
It will soon come back again

Though we go our separate ways
Looking for better days
Sharing our little boy
Who grew from joy back then

And it's all because of that love we knew
That makes the world go round
Separate ways, separate ways

Me for me, you for you
Happiness is never through
It's only a change of plan
And that is nothing new


And it's all because of that love we knew
That makes the world go round
And it's all because of the love we knew
It makes the world go round
Separate ways, separate ways Well, I'm going, I'm going
Going on a downhill slide
I'm going, I'm going
Going on a downhill slide
Things feel so easy
I'm never going to change my mind

I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

Well, ride me babe
Hang on to my hat
Ride me babe
Hang on to my hat
I'll howl like a wolf
Scream like an alley cat


Don't wanna change my mind
Don't wanna reel it in
Don't wanna stop this sliding honey
That's the shape I'm in
I'm going, I'm going on a downhill slide
Things feels so easy
I'm never going to change my mind


Watch me now, watch me now
Going, going, going, going, going Crossing the river in a big old boat
With a dollar bill in my hand
Gonna go fishing in the afternoon
Got a simple plan
Oh yeah, baby

I got to hold on
I got to be strong
I got to live long
And be with you

Lonely nights and lonely days
When i'm not with you
Learned to trust and i learned to give
Found a love that's true
Oh yeah, baby


Girl it shouldn't be too hard
To live with you
It's really not complicated
Until i get the blues
Come on over and sit right down
Let me take your hand
I got a love gonna fill you up
Take you to the promised land
Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah


Be with you baby
Be with you baby
I got to be with you babe
Be with you baby, oh alright

Lonely nights, lonely days
When i'm not with you babe
Learned to trust and i learned to give
Found a love that's true, babe
Oh yeah, baby Selling papers on the corner
I saw a man yesterday
I asked him if he'd wanna
Tell me what made him this way

He said, when it's born, it's warm
Then it gathers strength in lies
When it falls, it falls all over you

He used to pick his friends
They left him in the end
An easy thing to lose
The right to pick and choose
When it's born, it's warm
Then it gathers strength in lies
When it falls, it falls all over you
He said he left his wife
The back-bone of his life
Another came along
But now I guess she's gone


I think I used to see
That old man on TV
Can you be the same?
It seems like such a shame
When it's born, it's warm
Then it gathers strength in lies
When it falls, it falls all over you
The world he thought he knew
Has better things to do
As I went on my way
I thought I heard him say She looks so beautiful, with the top down
Let's jump inside and take a trip to town
(Let's hit the road) Let's make some miles and spend a little time
(And go to town) And when we get there we'll stop our only dime

(Let's hit the road) And go to town

On the freeway in the middle of the commute
Bumper to bumper in a giant cloud of fumes
From city to city everyone is on the move
(And go to town) Try to find the energy to stay in the groove


When I'm rolling on those big round wheels
Puts me in heaven that's exactly how I feel
Just jump inside and turn the key
Your satisfaction is guaranteed


Someone's trying to find the peoples fuel
No fear of failure for that crazy fool

(Let's hit the road) Pretty Maui Mama
Lying over the water
With my sun in your eyes
When you hear the melody play
It changes every day
Oh, Hawaiian sunrise

Once when we were there
We had relaxing times
Thought we might settle down
But the music called me
And my friends have
Much to spread around
We moved from town to town
Hawaiian sunrise

And in the morning when you rise
Will you look in my son's eyes?
I know you do - Well...
- I've prepared for you a canoe to sit in this
It's time for you to leave now, William Blake..
Time for you to go back to your kingdom
- There' s so cloudly...
- Back to the plays from where all the spirits came
And we are all the spirits between them
This world won't no wonder continues... Bad news is come to town
He's walking three feet off the ground
He's ordering another round
Bound by his own ideas
Lost, doesn't know where she is found
Bad news is fighting mad
He went and lost the biggest prize he ever had
But a prizefighter can't be sad
When he smiles under golden lights and lamps
Taking daylight fights again and again
Bad news is come to town
He's walking three feet off the ground
He's ordering another round
Bound by his own ideas
Lost, doesn't know where she is gone
Bad news is fighting mad
He went and lost the biggest prize he ever had
But a prizefighter can't be sad
When he smiles under golden lights and lamps
Taking daylight fights again and again
Bad news is come to town It's raining in paradise

Here come the clouds
There's a big wind blowing through town
The rooster crows
But we're sleeping in past dawn
It's raining in paradise

When you chase the sun
Chase it half way around the world
The rainbow comes
When you least expect it to


Sun comes up

When you chase the sun
Chase it half way around the world
The rainbow comes
When you least expect it to When the morning comes and you’re still sleeping
With all those dreams in your pretty head
I light a fire while the sun comes creeping
All across the meadow bed
The old clock has stopped, no longer ticking
No longer counting every second

Out by the car our snowman's melting
Nothing can bring him back now
His smile a twig and his nose a cucumber
His eyes two pine cones looking out
We got pictures of him like little kids laughing
In the snow we were walking hand in hand

We went looking for a big surprise
And we found before our eyes
Two white elk grazing on the green
Then we heard the honkers coming
Landing on the lake of summer
Nesting there and waiting for a dream

When the morning comes and you’re still sleeping
With all those dreams in your pretty head
I'll light a fire and the sun comes creeping
All across the meadow bed ""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl I may not mystify you
In your search for higher love
I may just slip right by you
With your eyes turned up above

We may not compromise
I may not suit your taste tonight
My love
But as the time goes by
You might think that I'm all right
My love, my heavy love

A noise, your phone is ringing
Or is that someone at your door
Inside your head I'm singing
Inside your heart I cry for more

You may not hear me calling
You may not feel me bawling out
My love
But heavy rocks are falling
Heavy love is coming down
My love, my heavy love



My heavy love I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love art blues
I went and played too hard
And I lost my mind
Oh, these love art blues
Leave me a heavy one

My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had

I spilled my promise cup
I really don't know why
Now the distance lies
Between you and I


I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love art blues
I went and played too hard I see the light
Of a thousand lamps
Burning in your eyes
Still i have to turn away
For you to stay alive

Because i was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run
I was born to run run run

Security had a hold on me
I had a thousand friends
But reality wasn't told to me
And i found out in the end Time for me to show my hand
Let them know just who I am
Because I've been down and back again

I'm so tired of talking to strangers
Close my eyes and I see the danger
I feel like making some changes

So tired of talking to strangers
Close my eyes and I see the danger
I feel like making some changes The Statue of Liberty
Is breathing in the air
Atlantis is waiting down below
Late at night, flashing lights
Are sighted in the air
It's no secret
What everybody knows
It really don't matter much
Which way I go
But remember
To pull over in the storm

Have you seen the evening coconut
Bobbing on the bay?
Standing on
The water's edge of stone
Someone there besides you
To hear the words you say
To show you things
Your eyes have never known

Evening coconut, evening coconut 

The Statue of Liberty
Is breathing in the air
While Atlantis
Is waiting down below
Late at night, flashing lights
Are sighted in the air
It's no secret
What everybody knows

Evening coconut  I feel like I just woke up
From a bad dream
And it's so good to have you
Sleeping by my side
Although I'm not so sure
If I even know your name
Hold on, baby, hold on
We can go gliding through the air
Far from the jeers and lies
Yeah you are the one
I'm talkin' to this morning
With your mind so fine
And your friendly body lying
In my bungalow with stucco
With glory and sunset spa
Hold on, baby, hold on
It doesn't matter if you're the one
Because we'll know before we're done I don't want to get personal
Why have you put me on the spot?
I don't know how you feel
But for me it's getting hard
Swimming in the deep blue sea
Marching in the big parade

All I need is a little shade
Standing in the light of love

Doesn't matter who you are
Or who you're not
All it takes is a little love
To make a handout worth a lot
Swimming in the deep blue sea
Marching in the big parade


Drowning in the deep blue sea
Drudging in the long parade

All I need is a little shade
Standing in the light of your love
Standing in the light of love Just like a young boy
Running down the road
I'm singing out
The same old song
Can't go back
The way I started from
The road goes on and on
Won't you help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Take my way on home
Help me make my way on home
After Berlin
Lights are shining
In the German sky
Cosmic walls
Between the moon and I
Don't know where I started from
So won't you take me, take me
Take me, take me
Take me, take me
Take me, take me
Just the way I am
Ah, take me, just the way I am
After Berlin
All day cruising
Down the corridor
Seeing things
I never seen before
Tomorrow morning in old Berlin
Where they lock you out
Or lock you in
Won't you save me, save me
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
From the final day
Save me from the final day
After Berlin
Just like a young boy
Running down the road
I'm singing out
The same old song
I can't go back
The way I used to go
The road goes on and on
Won't you help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Find my way back home
Won't you help me
Make my way on home
After Berlin
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me Tumbleweed
Your inner beauty is a peace sign to me
Life is full of little tricks and
We can always pick up sticks and build again
That’s what we do

Harmony
The way we hold on when we tumble through the night
Life is full of strange delights and
In the darkness we find lights to make our way
Back home again

Tumbleweed
I’m baring my soul to you
Tumbleweed
It’s all that I’ve got that’s true

Bite me now
With your confusion, your happiness and delight
It will only hurt a moment
Then it’s gone and you can see there’s nothing left
To leave a mark

Animal
Care for your kind, in the way you always do
When the flower moon is shining
It’s eclipse and your lips smiling comfort me
And I comfort you

Tumbleweed
Your inner beauty is a peace sign to me When you walk in a room
You hold your head up high
You talk to people eye to eye
There's nothing to hide
You're feeling so complete inside
Your heart feels so complete inside
Because you got love

If you got love
You know you got it
If you got love
Can't live without it
If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command

You're staring in the face of scorn
You know your spirit can't be torn
You're living like a satellite
Maintain your distance through the night
You know that something isn't right
Your heart tells you it's just not right
Because you got love


If you got love
The world you're walking in
Is at your command
If you got love to share  In the summertime we met to see a threat
That came to harm something we both loved
And as the hours passed
We talked until at last it came a time to part

I was doin' well and I thought she liked my style
I had no business feeling like that but it lasted quite a while
I got my promises made but before the timeless father
I showed plastic flowers to mother nature's daughter

She held the vase, her misty gaze brought them to life
I was amazed, she looked at me with a tear in her eye

We went to give our thanks along the riverbanks
And watched the water flow as it rolled along
She scooped some river sand and held it in her hand
And sang a little song
We saw the water lines left there from ancient times
I watched the sand falling through her fingers
On the shore, so dry

I was doin' well, I thought she liked my style
I had no business feeling like that but it lasted quite a while
I got my promises made but before the timeless father
I showed plastic flowers to mother nature's daughter Run around babe
I'm only losing my mind
Run around babe
Don't try to be
Something you weren't meant to be
If you are not loving me
I'll know it's because
You want to be free
Oh, oh, run around babe

When we were young
We left our worries behind
When we were young
Left not to be
The worry is back on me
And it's not hard to see
That that's the way it has to be
Oh, oh, run around babe I don't want to bring you down
I don't want to change you
All I want is
Your love again

You and I want different things
But we need each other
All I want is
Your love again
Love is always changing faces
Who knows what it means
The whole world is trying to find
The answer to it's dreams
Why should we lose what we got
We could rearrange it
All I want is
Your love again

I don't want to break your heart
I just want to hold you
All I want is
Your love again

You and I knew from the start
Now we got to make it happen
All I need is
Your love again
When you walked into my life
On the heels of a dream
I thought I saw in your eyes
A little bit of me

I don't want to change your life
I just want to share it
All I want is
Your love again

All I want is
Your love again If you travel with
Those who know you well
I can recommend
Stay at Love Hotel

Every room a hallway
Softly sell
Don't get stranded on the lift
Of the Love Hotel
Love Hotel 

Don't deny yourself
It wants simple truth
Ring for give and take
As the floor and room

Every room a hallway
Who can tell
Don't get stranded by the lift
Of the Love Hotel
Love Hotel 
Every room a hallway
Softly sell
Don't get stranded by the lift
Of the Love Hotel
Love Hotel, Love Hotel Believe me
When I tell you
That a love true
Isn't hard to find
Because I found mine
And she's so fine
Like a lifeline
From across the sea
None of the neighbors
Remember names
They only see the faces
With destinations still unnamed
It's hard to leave the traces
For someone to follow When the blues moved north to Chicago they came
And I caught some myself in this blind alley and rain
Close to the L with its clattering train
Near an ornate theater where I soon will be playing
Soon will be playing
I soon will be playing
Soon will be playing

So I said hello for you, when I saw a stylish girl
Walking by on the sidewalk with her hair all in a swirl
From the wind that was growing at the end of the day
And I wondered what would be coming my way
Oh what's coming my way
What's coming my way
Coming my way

You know I been to Chicago, I was here once before
And the rain kept on pounding outside that stage door
I was singing and drinking with love in my heart
I was younger and stronger while life played it’s part
Life played it’s part
Whoa, life played it’s part
Life played it’s part


Let us not be strangers if we come to know
Things about each other that come and they go
As friendship is everything if love is to last
And I have my guard down and love passes fast
Love passes fast
Love passes fast
Oh, love passes fast, yeah

Say hello to Chicago
Say hello
Say hello to Chicago I think I'd like to go back home
And take it easy
There's a woman that
I'd like to get to know
Living there
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows
Every time I think about back home
It's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now
Just passing time
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows Every time you touch her
Sets your hands on fire
And every thing you've got
Is all that she requires
And you hang on, hang on, hang on
To the words of a liar
You can feel it getting
Down to the wire
All the hurt you thought was gone
Has now returned
And every thing she's laughing at
Is all you learned
And you let go, let go, let go
'cause you know you're getting tired
Can you feel it getting
Down to the wire?
Take the time to close your
Eyes and look around
'Cause anyone who helped you out
Can let you down
And look out, look out, look out
The voice is now the choir
Can you feel it getting
Down to the wire?  When I’m riding down the road in my car travelin' without you
I can still see you sittin’ there, right by my side
With the headlights of the oncoming cars flashin' in the windshield
There’s a glimmer of everything that I once saw in you

Tough love can leave you almost alone
But new love brings back everything to you
All the feelings in your heart come re-awakened

Like a forest without leaves on it’s trees standing in the desert
Like the light that still leaks through when you close the door
Like the changes in our life that hits so hard that day I couldn’t find you
There’s a glimmer of everything good that once came before

Tough love can leave you almost alone
But new love brings back everything to you
All the feelings in your heart come re-awakened

And there’s a glimmer of everything good that once came before
There’s still a glimmer of everything that I first saw in you Mediterranean
If I could meet you there
Who would ever care
We'll get in right on time
Right on time
Right on time
I dreamed my dream and I
Were walking in the rain
A sudden spirit came
And made us go away
To holiday from fame
Vacation came
Mediterranean Live to ride, ride my dream machine
Good conditions sometime are extreme
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine

Going to take a long, long time
But the stain will fade away
Running from the daily grind
He was, he was a friend of mine

Live to ride, ride in the lonesome wind
Cross the line, you can't come back again
Never let a dream machine
Gather dust in your garage


Live to ride, ride my dream machine Well, I'm a little light-headed
But my body feels the same
And it feels like falling on down
And find another name
But the sand in my shoes
May trickle to my brain
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more tame
Oh yeah, something more tame 
Well the sound of the drums
Is pounding in my head
Like ten thousand dancers
With bodies full of lead
And I feel like a bull
With an eye-full of red
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something better bred
Oh yeah, something better bred 
If tomorrow sees another
Kind of farm I know
Well, the people and the soldiers
And the gypsies groan
It would be like a wonder
And I cannot let it go
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more slow
Oh yeah, something more slow 
But the people in the cities
And the other ones too
Ain't got too many wonders
That they're not tied to
And I can't help but feeling
As I'm wearing straight through
Well, I ain't got the blues
But something more true
Oh yeah, something more true  Living on the edge of night
You know the sun won't go down slow
You don't know what drug is right
Can't decide which way you want to go
I feel the way you feel
Because not so long ago
It had a hold on me
I couldn't let it go
It couldn't set me free
It wouldn't set me free
No more, no more, no more, no more

Seemed like the easy thing
To let it go for one more day
Like singing the same old song
And twisting the words
In a different way
Where did the magic go?
I searched high and low
I can't find it no more
I can't get it back
I can't find it no more
I can't find it no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

Searching for quality
Having to have the very best
Now scrounging for quantity
Never having time
To do the test
That's how the story goes
Can't put it down
Till the last page
You can't put it down
You can't put it down
I can't put it down, put it down
No more, no more There's a face in the window
Looking back at me
There's a face in the window
I just can't see
That face in the window
Keeps haunting me
I went walking after midnight
Up and down the street
I went walking after midnight
Up and down the street
When I stopped for a smoke
I heard shuffling feet

Well, I stopped for a smoke
What did I see?
A face in the filter
Looking back at me

Ah, listen to me baby
Hear what I have to say
Yeah, listen to me baby
Hear what I have to say
These midnight blues
They won't go away
These midnight blues
Won't go away

Yeah, I stopped for a smoke
What did I see?
A face in the filter
Looking back at me

I'm walking after midnight
Well, I'm walking after midnight Here comes another day
And another
I got so many ills and pills
I'm about to smother
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got

I tried to tell myself
It doesn't matter
It's just the time of life
Another rung in the ladder
Each morning I
Look in her sky-blue eyes
The downside of life looks better
That old man standing on the corner
He should be proud of those lines on his face
Because either he's been laughing too much
Or feeling too much pain

Here comes another day
And another
I sure am glad
I got you for a lover
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got

That old man standing on the corner
He should be proud
Of those lines on his face
Because either he's
Been smiling too much
Or feeling too much pain

Here comes another day
And another
I sure am glad
I got you for a lover
Hit 39, I'm leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got
Hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
Holding on to what I got Come along and say you will
Be the one to change the meaning
Of the writing on the wall
The lonely politician
Is lying in the hall

Come along and say you can
Be the one to take this feeling
I'll never understand
Why walk around the center
With a nail through your hand?
It's another way to run
It's a lonely weekend
And what have you done?
You know you got
A reason to run, babe
You know you got
A reason to hide, babe


It's another way to run
It's a lonely weekend
And what have you done?
You know you got
A reason to run, babe
You know you got
A reason to hide, babe

Come along and say you can
Be the one to take this feeling
I'll never understand
Why walk around the center
With a nail through your hand?  The summer ends and the winter winds
Begin to holler all around the bend
We will smile and sail away
This won't be no sadness day
When the winter winds
Greet the trees back there

We can watch the turbine
Turning in the wind
Up on the ridge line
Before the fog rolls in
Falling leaves in the autumn air
People feeling good everywhere
When the winter winds greet
The trees back there

We can watch the turbine
Blowing in the wind
Up on the ridge line
Before the fog rolls in
We will smile and sail away
This won't be no sadness day
When the winter winds
Greet the trees back there When you see the golden trigger
Stand before your eyes
By the time you stop to figure
Lady Wingshot flies away

You are so inviting
And I feel so in tune with you
Your draw is fast as lightning
My eyes are captured by your moves

You ride in three-ring splendor
I find I'm rising with the crowd
Too small for you to see me
Although I'm yelling right out loud
When you see the golden trigger
Stand before your eyes
By the time you stop to figure
Lady Wingshot flies away


My my, Lady Wingshot
Why can't you slow down in a crowd
Bye bye, Lady Wingshot
Each blow is ringing true and loud My brother went to prison
He's in Kingston doing time
He got seven years for selling
What I've been smoking all my life

Time off for good behavior
But the boy don't feel too good
Locked behind those steel bars
I don't know if he should
Yeh a few years ago they called me
Back home to get a big award
They also called my brother
But they made him say ""My Lord""
They locked me up in a Hall of Fame
And threw away the keys
But when they put my brother away
It really did something to me

Now I'm guilty as hell for saying
""Boy you better go back home""
You know you'll
Get a fair shake there
We're running all alone
When he called me up
From the border
With the Mounties on his tail
I said go back to Canada
We can raise the bail

Now I get these letters
From a cell with no TV
He says he's outside one hour
And inside twenty three
Time off for good behavior
But the boy don't feel too good
Locked behind those steel bars
I don't know if he should I told you babe once before
Don't want you hanging
Around my door

You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder
Cause honey
I don't love you anymore

I told you babe, you're no good
Don't want you
Messing up my neighborhood

You better find another shoulder
Find another shoulder, babe
Find another shoulder
Cause honey
I don't love you anymore

Find another shoulder
Cause honey
I don't love you anymore Never thought love had a rainbow on it
Used to think a cloud was a nightmare
That was up until I first met you
Now I go around hoping you care
Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Never thought love had a rainbow on it
See the girl dance
See the girl dance
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers
California sand lies in her hand
Love her more than life as the daylight lingers
Early in the morning I'll be her man
Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers
See the girl dance
See the girl dance  There was an ill wind blowing
Through my hair last night
That froze me in my blue jeans
I couldn't find a light
I know that something's coming
I can feel it in my bones
Thank God for those old country boys
I ain't out here alone
My friends all tell me
I got daggers in my eyes
There's an anger in my heart
That they don't realize
I'm mad as hell at something
That I don't understand
Thank God I'm on the road tonight
With this old hillbilly band

Thank God I'm on the road tonight
With this old hillbilly band
We may not be good looking
But we sure get out of hand
Was that The Devil's stagecoach
Flying over the Rio Grande?
Thank God I'm on the road tonight
With this old hillbilly band

I swear that The Devil
Came visiting me last night
Surrounded my old stagecoach
With his eerie light
He was pounding on my windows
Rattling my wheels
I may not be The Devil
But I know just how he feels  We live in a modern world
With communication between boy and girl
Oh Yeah
But under the stars above
We just don't recognize the power of love is free

We got to change 
We got to change how we feel
We got to change 

When anger has closed the door
My eyes go blind
And I can see inside
I hurt you and you hurt me
With crimes of love
In the first degree
Oh yeah


We live in a modern world
With communication
Between boy and girl
Oh yeah
But when there are clouds above
We just don't recognize
The power of love is free Someone wants to blow up the planet
Johnny wants to find out why
Johnny did a show in St. Louis
Love came through the sky
Oh yeah, they were camped out
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah, Johnny sang out
Love into the sky

Johnny found a place out in Texas
Waiting for him to come
Made himself a reservation
And hope came, in the gun

Oh yeah, he was flying
Waiting for the sun to rise
Oh yeah, color by numbers
Waiting for the sun to rise
Johnny did some time in the army
Johnny did a stint in Vietnam
Now he can't forget it
His mind is confused
Slipping from his twisted hand
Oh yeah, he's still back there
With one hand on the gun
Oh yeah, he's still back there
Waiting for the rising sun

Now Johnny likes to go down the highway
The wind singing in his ears
Right up as most things go whirring by
By day everything looks clear
Oh yeah, Johnny ride on
Gonna find a special home
Oh yeah, down the highway
Looking for the rising sun  Someday you’ll want me
Someday you're gonna get back there
Someday you’ll see me, like you used to do

I got my problems
But they mostly show up with you
Someday you’ll see me, like you used to do

I couldn’t satisfy you
Just couldn’t show you my love
But I kept on trying
I tried and I tried
The time went by
You just didn’t want it no more


Some day you’ll want me
Someday you’re gonna get back there
Someday you’re gonna need me, like you used to do  Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today
When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over
Nestled in your wings, my little one
This special morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today
When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over  So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you

It’s not that we got anything new
It’s not that it’s any better or worse
The way life treats us is a blessing and a curse
I’m glad I found you

When you’re walking in a crowded place
I’ll try to hide you and give you space
And I’ll protect you from the things that come
I’m glad I found you

The other day when you took my hand
We walked away to the promised land
When I feel your soul in mine
I’m glad I found you

I'm glad I found you in this sad world
Where so many things have gone wrong
It took me so long just to find you
Right where we belong
I’m glad I found you in this mad world
You’re a lifeline to me
And when I hold you I will shield you
From the things that we both see

So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you I wanna drive my car
I wanna drive my car
Further and further on down the road
I wanna drive my car

I need a place to go
I need a place to go
Further and further on down the road
I need a place to go

I gotta find my way
I gotta find my way
Further and further on down the road
I gotta find my way

I wanna drive my car
I wanna drive my car
Further and further on down the road
I wanna drive my car

I gotta find some fuel
I gotta find some fuel
Further and further on down the road
I gotta find some fuel Now, New York City on a Friday night
A lot of things happenin', a lot of bright lights
Saw a pretty woman all dressed in red
She turned to me and this is what she said
She said, Honey I got the blues
I got the blues from ridin' all night in these high heel shoes
Well, she took me to the corner that she called her home
Turned around and we were all alone
Come on in, she said with a smile
Come on in and we can rest a while
Well, Honey I got the blues
I got the blues from ridin' all night in these high heel shoes
I said, Listen here, honey, I been around
You ain't foolin' me, 'cause I know what you've found
She bent kinda low and then she tickled my lips
She said, Listen here, son. I'm gonna give you a tip
Honey I got the blues
I got the blues from ridin' all night in these high heel shoes The end has come
The sky has lost it's sun
The harm is done
He was the only one
There goes my babe
There goes what might have been
There goes my babe
In the cool morning rain
And now my heart
Lies empty and still again
If he were here
I'd long to hold him near
But now it's clear
The price of love is dear
There goes my babe
There goes what might have been
There goes my babe
In the cool morning rain
And now my heart
Lies empty and still again Is my world not falling down
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you
Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home
City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you Protect the wild, tomorrow's child
Protect the land from the greed of man
Take out the dams, stand up to oil
Protect the plants and renew the soil

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

Ban fossil fuel, draw the line
Before we build one more pipeline
End fracking now, let's save the water
And build a life for our sons and daughters

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

Damn the dams, save the rivers
Starve the takers and feed the givers
Let's build the green and save the world
We're the people known as Earth

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me When I watch you sleeping, there’s nothing that you hide
When I smell you breathing there’s a sweetness from inside
And when I feel you stirring and the day is about to break
Outside wings are whirring and the sky is there to take

I wonder how I got so close to you
And see the chances that you take
Without thinking I’m going there too
These are the promises you make
When your eyes are blinded by love
And the history of fate

When I hear you purring like a kitten and a lion
And I feel your softness, how you got it without trying
Then you roll and tumble with your dreams still holding on
And I hear that rumble in the stomach of the dawn

Today I paint my masterpiece
Tonight I trace my tears
Thinking through my path to you
And where I stumbled through the years


Today I paint my masterpiece
Tonight I trace my tears
Thinking through the road I took to you
And how I stumbled through the years
That’s when I knew I’d never hold you down
Repeating old roads and fears

Now the crows are calling and the blackbirds sing in my ear
You got one eye open and I’m smiling through my tears
But you’ll never see them, they're inside with my fears
In a place that’s fading away and taking on new years  Down the highway
All across the nation
Trucks are moving rough
We pass the break of day
Sure looks like

We're all going to rock forever
Rock, rock, rock

After midnight you see
The big trucks rolling
Pushing metal on down the super slab
Sure hard to tell from here
Where we are going
Rock, rock, rock
Do it inside, do it outside, baby
Do it over again in the same old way
From now on


Sure looks like
We're all going to rock forever
The way we just keep rolling on and on
Yeah, sure looks like Stupid white men. William Blake, you go to them

What? Why don't we just go around them?

No, you go

I’d rather not

It's a test

I don't know those people. I don’t know if they're friendly or if they'll kill me

Nobody will observe

All right, I'll go. I'd rather not, but I'll go. What's the fastest way to get down there?

Be quiet and go Old man lying
By the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking
From the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping
Down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying
By the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Blind man running
Through the light
Of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down
To the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing
Through the window
In the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying
In a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around Everybody's sayin' music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Every one, yes, every one
Everybody's sayin' music, music is love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' that music is love
Everybody's sayin' it's love
Put on your colors and run, come see
Everybody says that music's for free
Take off your clothes and lie in the sun
Everybody says the music's for fun We used to laugh and play games together
We found things to do in stormy weather
But now I find you're leaving me behind
Casting me away from you
I try to tell myself it doesn't matter
I can find someone who'll treat me better
But now I see that you are leaving me
Casting me away from you
Someday maybe you'll know
You broke my heart in two
I hope that someday
You'll come back again
'Cause I'll be waitin' 'til you do
But now I find you're leaving me behind
Casting me away from you
I try to tell myself it doesn't matter
I can find someone who'll treat me better
But now I see that you are leaving me
Yes, I see that you are leaving me
Casting me away from you Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress
From you
What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take from me
And put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress from you
So long woman I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back maybe I was wrong
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress
From you No I'm not gonna
Hide my feelings
Couldn't if I tried
No, I'm not holding them inside
Holding back is
So close to stealing
Though we both have pride
We could lose it all if we lied
Someday it's later than
The feeling we have now
It's off the ground
I've always played around
But now I don't know how
Listen easy
'Cause I'm saying
What I mean this time
Sharing words I always said were mine
I was breezy
Now I'm swaying
Like the tree we climbed
Asking you to give me one more sign Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For thе loser now will be later to win
For thе times, they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin' When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey thru the past
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey thru the past
And I won't be back till February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey thru the past
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind? Come to see her in the river?
She'll be there to wave to you
In the hope that you'll forgive her
She will join you there
Find out that now was
The answer to answers
That you gave later
She did the things that
We both did before now
But who forgave her
Now you see how down you've fallen
Now you hear your conscious call
Thank yourself alone for stallin'
I'm not there to call
Call me a fool 'cause
I need her, and see her
But now you're down
Something inside you
Will tell you I'm wise to
What you're spreadin' round
If I could stand to see her cryin'
I would tell her not to care
When she learns of all your lyin'
Would she join you there?
Find out that now was
The answer to answers
That you gave later Your silver child suspended in space
Crying out to you
Beckons you to yet another fine place
Where the trials of life are few
Don't think you're living long
Who says you are coming on
They won't remember you
The rent is always due
The cloudy men who take their place
And stand in line they do
Know not of the satin face
That separates them from you
Just put your blue jeans on
Grab your guitar and sing a song
Don't think I'm kidding you
The rent is always due
She rides a broom with gold-plated straw
She flutters around and she cries
The Brylcream fools just standing on
Digesting all their lives
But then you walk along
And she starts coming on
Beneath her melting broom
The rent is always due Who's that stomping
All over my face?
Where's that silhouette
I'm trying to trace?
Who's putting sponge
In the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy
Before she's begun
To singing the meaning
Of what's in my mind
Before I can take home
What's rightfully mine
Joinin' and listenin'
And talkin' in rhymes
Stoppin' the feeling
To wait for the times
Who's saying baby
That don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy
Can't even sing
And who's all hung-up
On that happiness thing?
Who's trying to tune
All the bells that he rings?
And who's in the corner
And down on the floor
With pencil and paper
Just counting the score?
And who's trying to act
Like he's just in between?
The line isn't black
If you know that it's green
Don't bother looking
You're too blind to see
Who's coming on
Like he wanted to be
Who's saying baby
That don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays
Clancy can't even sing
And who's coming home
On the old nine-to-five?
Who's got the feeling
That he came alive
Though havin' it, sharin' it
Ain't quite the same
It ain't no gold nugget
You can't lay a claim
Who's seeing eyes
Through the crack in the floor
There it is baby
Don't you worry no more
Who should be sleepin'
But is writing this song
Wishin' and a-hopin'
He weren't so damned wrong
Who's saying baby
That don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy
Can't even sing Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you’re thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
It’s so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh, to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You’re leaving there too soon
You’re leaving there too soon
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you’re givin' back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you’re thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
Now you say you're leavin' home
'Cause you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon

You're leaving there too soon Well, hello lonely woman
Won't you take a walk with me
I know a place where we can go
Grab a bite to eat
Hello lonely woman
Are you feelin’ all right?
Well, you look just like heaven
On a clear clear night
Well, I know you're a lonely woman
And I know what's on your mind
I won’t ask you any favors
I'm familiar with your kind
I know you need me
Like a river needs rain
I won't ask you any favors
Until I pass this way again
Well, hello lonely woman
Won't you take a walk with me
I know a place where we can go
Grab a bite to eat
Hello lonely woman
Are you feelin' all right?
Well, you look just like heaven
On a clear clear night
Well, I know you're a lonely woman
And I know what's on your mind
I won't ask you any favors

Like a river needs rain
I won’t ask you any favors
Until I pass this way again"
