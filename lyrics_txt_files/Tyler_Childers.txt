"Well my buckle makes impressions
On the inside of her thigh
There are little feathered Indians
Where we tussled through the night
If I'd known she was religious
Then I wouldn't have came stoned
To the house of such an angel
Too fucked up to get back home

Lookin' over West Virginia
Smoking Spirits on the roof
She asked ain't anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you
I said many folks have warned me
There's been several people try
But up till now, there ain't been nothing
That I couldn't leave behind

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight Early in the morning when the sun does rise
Layin' in the bed with bloodshot eyes
Late in the evenin' when the sun sinks low
That's about time my rooster crows
I got women up and down this creek
And they keep me going and my engine clean
Run me ragged but I don't fret
Cause there ain't been one slow me down none yet
Get me drinking' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the highwall
Throw'em in the river and get your fill
We been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
I got people try to tell me, Red
Keep this livin' and you'll wind up dead
Cast your troubles on the Lord of Lord's
Or wind up laying on a cooling board
But I got buddies up White House Road
And they keep me strutting when my feet hang low
Rotgut whiskey gonna ease my pain
'N all this runnin's gonna keep me sane
Get me drinking' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the highwall
Throw'em in the river and get your fill
We been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads
When you lay me in the cold hard clay
Won't ya sing them hymns while the banjo plays
You can tell them ladies that they ought not frown
Cause there ain't been nothing ever held me down
Lawmen, women or a shallow grave
Same ol' blues just a different day
Get me drinking' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the highwall
Throw'em in the river and get your fill
We been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads Daddy worked like a mule minin' Pike County coal
'Til he fucked up his back, couldn't work anymore
He said, ""One of these days you'll get out of these hills
""Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills""

""See, the ways of this world will just bring you to tears
""Keep the Lord in your heart and you'll have nothin' to fear
""Live the best that you can and don't lie and don't steal
""Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills""

Daddy I've been tryin', I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord, they bring me the chills
""Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills""

""Keep in mind that a man's just as good as his word
""It takes twice as long to build bridges you've burnt
""And there's hurt you can cause time alone cannot heal
""Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills""

Well daddy I've been tryin', I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord, they bring me to chills
""Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills""
""Keep your nose on the grindstone"" Drivin' through the road work, oh, the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like mem'ries of the miles we shared between
The place you learned to say your prayers, the place I took to prayin'
Loadin' in and breakin' down my road dog door deal dreams
Long before we ever met, I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd have gone about it
You follow me and lead me on and never let me down

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine

Fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
Every bite and curtain drawn, I wanna taste with you
Goddess in my Days Inn pen, the muse I ain't refusin'
The part of me that ain't around I'm always talking to

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
No, there ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine Tina Nolan had a man with a good place for siftin’
He invited me diggin’, so I picked up my screen
And a shovel to dig and a jar of shine
He traded me fair for a bottle of wine
His brother’s Barnes Mountain wine
We trudged through the snow straight up the hillside
Took a ridge for a while, then we slowly went down
To an overhang  hid from the ridgeline
We bent o'er our handles and we bit in the ground
The dark and bloody ground
Was a bitch to break ground but the wine kept us goin'
The moonshine was flowin' and keepin' us warm
'Cause you can’t hold a girl with a fistful of shovel
Got to find your fire in the company of corn
We dug for a while then it all turned to ashes
Found a bunch of broke flint and a few bits of bone
Then I heard Jesse yell o'er the pile he was sifting
Shook the hills like the angels were callin’ us home
Jesse, Zachary come home
It was banded as hell, it was fluted and clovis
It was hot as the pistol I kept on my side
I was fiending so fierce, I was broke ass and busted
I pulled out my pistol and I took Jesse’s life
A clovis like that is a hard point to find
Makes pills swift to come by with a good chunk of change
Left over for burn on whatever meanness
Whatever woman is comin' my way
Darlin' come my way
I sit in this cell for the banded clovis
I stole off of Nolan when I killed'm that day
I reckon the chase of the pills and the powder
Corn liquor and women are the culprits to blame You remind me of a Sunday
Back home in ole' Kentucky
With the church choirs just beltin' through the pines
And I love you like the mountains
Love's the way the mornin' opens
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones
Well I used to ride a Mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
Til' they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay
So I let that car just sit there
When I should've took you driving
With the windows down while the music played
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones
Darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones Back before these calloused hands and all this work
We used to sit up at the flats
Actin' like we'd live forever
Gettin' high and skippin' class

Yeah, I reckon we were heathens
But in her eyes we were saints
Now you're callin' all the boys home
'Cause heaven's angels carried her away

So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

Back when all us boys were tryin'
To make sense of all these strings
I can see her in the corner
Singin' along to all our crazy dreams

So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

I will follow you to Virgie
'Cause that's what us boys are for
To help you out when you get weary
And you can't go no more

And can't you see her up there, Cody
I can see her through the pines
Sayin' ""Boys be good"" I only had a couple drinks last night
And few good hits from an end of a pipe
And I must admit, I had a few white lines
And I don't know what all happened
I woke up in the noon time light
With a poundin' head, shiner on my eye
And I don't know how and I don't why
But it feels like fierce abandon

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God

Pay no mind to the words I say
Cause they ain't no count anyway
I been ramblin' around and led astray
By the paths that I been choosin'
Cuttin' paths like a forest fire
Pupils wider than backhoe tires
Throwin' my money on a funeral pyre
But it sure feels good abusin'

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God

Bands too loud for their bible thumpin'
Feels too good to not count for somethin'
Big Sandy rock, Sludge River roll
Goddamn, fire in the hole
Look out baby, I'm bound to blow
I'm bound to blow a gasket
Damn good gig, good damn crowd
Good God, for cryin' out loud
Coming off stage I was mighty proud
Then I don't know what all happened

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God
I swear to God Up in Pocahontas in the Cranberry Glades
Ain’t got bars, nor the charge to call her anyways
My mind’s a mile a minute
And my thoughts they bark like hounds
I focus on my breathing and the universal sound
I think about my darlin' girl sleepin' all alone
I pray the stars will shoot her all the wishes she can hold
On the day that I return I aim to lay her down
But right now I am focused on the universal sound
I think about tobacco juice and mason jars of shine
I think about the vices I’ve let take me over time
I recall when I's a baby, I didn’t need nothin' around
But a little bitty rattler and the universal sound
I'd close my eyes
It was all so clear
It was all right then
It was all right here
I focus on my breathin’ and the universal sound
I let it take me over from the toenails to the crown
Of the body that I’m in till they put me in the ground
And I return to the chorus of the universal sound
I’ve been up on the mountain
And I’ve seen his wondrous grace
I’ve sat there on a barstool  and I’ve looked him in the face
He seemed a little haggard, but it did not slow him down
He was hummin' to the neon of the universal sound You can go to hell, my dear
You'd probably like it better there
With all them boys who thought they could make it
Deadman's curve gonna lay them down
All the things you put me through
Safe to say I'm tired of you
Had our times, yeah we had a few
But where we gonna be when the pills run out
Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose
And the white line fever gets a hold of you
How we gonna make it to higher ground
If you won't get up and leave
I reckon if I chose to stay
It'd be better for a few more days
But it the end it always rains
And honey, you can cause a storm
But I'm tired and soakin' wet
And hunkered over trying to catch my breath
Broke my back and did my best
To hold you through the shakes
But it's hard to keep floatin' on foundered dream
You're takin' in water at crazy speed
How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat
My heart was never much on games
Let alone the ones you play
I've only got one and it's already broken
So why you wanna throw it around
I wish I had the strength to go
But it's a long and hateful road
And I just now got to feelin' at home
And the frost you put on me
Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose
And the white line fever gets a hold of you
How we gonna make it to higher ground
If you won't get up and leave
And it's hard to keep floatin' on foundered dream
You're takin' in water at crazy speed
How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat
You can go to hell, my dear
You'd probably like it better there
With all them boys who thought they could make it
Deadman's curve gonna lay them down It's the worst that it's been since the last time it happened
It's happening again right in front of our eyes
There's updated footage, wild speculation
Tall tales and hearsay and absolute lies
Been passed off as factual, when actually the actual
Causes they're awkwardly blocking the way
Keeping us all from enjoyin' our evening
Shoving its roots through the screens in our face
Now, what would you get if you heard my opinion
Conjecturin' on matters that I ain't never dreamed
In all my born days as a white boy from Hickman
Based on the way that the world's been to mе?
It's called me belligеrent, it's took me for ignorant
But it ain't never once made me scared just to be
Could you imagine just constantly worryin'
Kickin' and fightin', beggin' to breathe?
How many boys could they haul off this mountain
Shoot full of holes, cuffed and layin' in the streets
'Til we come into town in a stark ravin' anger
Looking for answers and armed to the teeth?
Thirty-ought-sixes, Papaw's old pistol
How many, you reckon, would it be, four or five?
Or would that be the start of a long, violent history
Of tucking our tails as we try to abide?
Or would that be the start of a long, violent history
Of tucking our tails as we try to abide? Charleston girl in a darkened room
And you don't know her like I do
We took the fire escape to her room
And got stone-raging blind
Left my money in the trusting hands
Of them old Steele Brothers in a 'fastgrass' band
One day I'm gonna drive up there
And give them half my mind
I don't know if it's the wine or the coke
That makes her sound like her jaw is broke
She's working hard to make some sense
But she ain't got a dime
I wish to God that I could help her out
I wish I knew what she was talkin' bout
I wish to God that I could get away
But I'm way too drunk to drive
All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why, but every time I cross that river, Lord
There's somethin' tears me up and makes me wild
Charleston girl with raven hair
Bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
I believe if I could find my keys
I'd try to drive away
I never planned to leave so soon
I didn't know that he was sweet on you
Go ahead and take her
Cause she ain't worth the time
All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why but every time I cross that river
Lord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild I am now the one she left
A haunted tale for someone else
A little bit about herself
Wherever she is sleeping
Flint strikes out to pierce the dark
Cause a flame from just one spark
Fill the room with smoke so harsh
She exhales a memory
The past is fadin'
Over time, but it's still hangin' on for life
I'm now her used to be
He is now the one she needs
He is now the one she leans on
She looks out at the sunset
On a quilt of rags he holds her tight
And they raise a toast of Bulleit Rye
Whiskey kills all things in time
Like things she don't remember
The past is fadin'
Over time, but it's still hanging on for life
I am now an old headstone
And to her grave I'll die alone
A testament of how she's grown
Wherever she is sleepin'
The past is fadin'
Over time, but it's still hanging on for life Once I was a dying breed
Chewin’ on an ancient leaf
Before we took the notion
To keep up with the times
And leave ‘em all behind
Chisel to the paper
Tattoos on the ether
Fadin’ in the light
All the while I'd gorge my gut
Come the time then I would rut
Runnin’ high and low to find my prehistoric queen
To keep me warm till Spring
When I'd go out with my friends
Graze the land and wonder when I’d see your face again
Till the day I met my doom
I took one in the boiler room
To put food on the table of a dying breed of man
Once I was a broken heart
And once I tore your heart apart
Once my heart put out before I ever got to breathe
But my soul returned to seed
And come to Earth again
Clucking out a livin' as the favorite layin' hen
'Til the day I met my doom
A fox got in the chicken coop
Doin' all he knew to do to feed a hungry den
On and on down the line
I’ve swam canals and bore the hide
Of plenty births along this ride of being born again
Once I was and you were too
And we were both the word of truth
We built this world together with a loud and mighty bang
Lord it sounded like a train
And echoed o’er the land
And we came up with a game to play of being born again Will you pray for me
When the roots of the oak
And my ribcage are braidin’
If I can think
Lord knows that I will fondly pray for you
High on the hill where the fox horns blow
And down in the grave where they lay me low
Catholic girl, pray for me
You’re my only hope for Heaven
When I's a boy
I’d drink and love and smoke and snort my fill
But all the while
I kept in mind the Lord’s redeeming grace
High on the hill where the fox horns blow
And down in the city where the heathens go
Catholic girl, pray for me
You’re my only hope for Heaven
Do you reckon he lets Free Will
Boys mope around in purgatory
I know that Hell
Is just as real as I am surely breathin’
But I’ve heard tale
Of a middle ground, I think will work for me
When the time has come for changin' worlds
I’ll hedge my bets with a Catholic girl
Catholic girl, pray for me
You’re my only hope for Heaven “Hard Times”

I bought a house at the mouth of the holler, a ring at the pawn shop, and a crib for the kid
I heard some word there was work up in Hindman
I'm going tomorrow and hope that there is
My sweat and my wages they don't seem to weight out
I'm gettin' more aches than I'm gainin' in gold
Whoever said you could raise you a family just a'workin' your ass off knee deep in coal?
Well the sign at the church says I'll reap what I'm sowin'
But I ain't lost sleep because it'll come in due time
If the Lord wants to take me I'm here for the taking. '
Cause hell's probably better than tryin' to get by
You can see me on the front page
It'll be out tomorrow
A boy in his 20's, shot down in his prime
For trying to hold up the Texaco station
They'll say I was desperate
They're probably right
I bought a house at the mouth of the holler, a ring at the pawn shop, and a crib for the kid
I heard some word there was work up in Hindman
I'm going tomorrow and hope that there is By the banks of the river
Where the willows hang down
The wild birds they warble
With a low moanin' sound
Way down in the hollow
Where the river runs cold
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told
Now I lie on my back
And I see your sweet face
The past I remember
Time can't erase
And the letters you wrote me
They were written in shame
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name
Now if the ladies were blackbirds
If the ladies were thrushes
Well I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly cold marshes
And if the women were squirrels
With them high bushy tails
Well I'd load up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails
I'd load up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails Well tonight, I'm up in Chillicothe
Down-wind from the paper mill
I’m out here spittin' on the sidewalk
Taking in the factory smells
Head and nose, she tends to smokin' out the window
In the air, that gas pipe leak
I wonder if she’s cringing at the same time
Thinking pretty thoughts of me

I was up for hours this morning
Pulling traps before I said goodbye
I plan to tan myself a fox hide
And hang it on my darling bride
'Cause they tell me that it's gonna be a big one
And the snow is settin' in
And I don't want her cold while I ain't at home
The way that I have been

Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I’m sitting by the fire
Huddled with my honey in the Country Squire

Well tomorrow, we hit the country music highway
On our way to Circleville
We’re off to do some weekend warring
While we sing and drink our fill
And when I ain't out playing on my six-string
With the nickels I acquire
I’m trying to fix her up a castle
It's called the Country Squire

It's a 24-foot-long vessel
That measures eight feet wide
It's a 53-year-old camper
It’s made to pull behind
And I've gutted to the studs and the rafters
And I'm building back piece by piece
I'm trying to fix her up a temple
My Lady of the Estill Springs

Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire

One day, I aim to have myself a family
And a cabin on the hill
And I might have to come off of the highway
To help with the family bills
But when the kids have got a little older
On the day that I retire
I'll take her somewhere warm for the winter
Pulling our Country Squire

Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire I was out of my mind the first night we met
I was feeling lonely and blue
I'd just moved to the country to get me some rest
The city can put a hurtin' on you
Especially a fella from eastern Kentucky
Without a penny or a worth to his name
Wasting his life on a burnin' desire
And chasing that honky tonk flame
You were soft on the eyes and a Hymn on the hearing
Leaving me helpless of lines
To get you to listen to the way I was feelin'
And the plans I had made for our night
Hold on now buddy won't ya wait up a minute
You're mistaken if you think I'm the same
As them skirts you've been chasin' all over town
Along with that honky tonk flame
I'm a woman with a love so true
Truth of the matter I'd give it to you
You just got to slow down, quit actin' that way
Burnin' your barn in this honky tonk flame
You were sweet to the touch
And a touch for the takin'
The minute I learned how to breathe
Finally found out that the love of a woman
Who loved me was all that I'd need
Still on the road cause I ain't good for nothin'
Except writing the songs that I sing
Beating them strings like they're owing me money
And chasing that honky tonk flame
But I got me a woman with a love so true
Darlin' to me but that's missus to you
All I did was slow down and quit actin' insane
Burnin' my barn in this honky tonk flame She likes stealin' from Salvation Armies
She says it makes her feel like the movies
Battin' her eyes with a crooked smile
Wonderin' why the hell I'm pissed
This ain't like any film that I recall
It ain't exactly The Italian Job
This kinda shit is for soccer moms
Dyin' to be young again

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah-print body-suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

She tells me I got a problem with drinkin'
But loves going out on the weekends
Throws me the keys with a ""pretty please""
And wonders if I'll drive her home
You'd think if she knew my weakness
She'd try and help me to beat it
That's why I love her so but since Roanoke
I don't take her out to shop no more

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah-print body-suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

She likes stealin' from Salvation Armies
She says it makes her feel like the movies
Battin' her eyes with a crooked smile
Wonderin' why the hell I'm pissed

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah-print body-suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah-print-body suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid They got my favorite lotion here
Something in a hotel I admire
I got the pictures that you sent me
And how they fill me with desire
Tonight, we've all got our own rooms
I’m about to burn mine down
'Cause I miss you somethin' fierce
In this quaint New England town
I read the texts you whispered plain
Everything you aim to do
I sure do like the way you think
That’s the way I'm thinking too
I see it play out in my mind
You and I unite as one
The van don't leave 'til 10 AM
And we've only just begun

This one here goes out to you
Lord, wherever you may be
When you're reaching for the fruit
I pray you'll fondly think of me
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone ’cause I’m your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever lovin' hand

For a moment, you were here
Moment passed and you were gone
Leavin’ me to clean the mess
That you clearly helped to cause
When the boys ask how I slept
I'll just look 'em in the eye
Tell them all you'd come to visit
I didn’t get a wink of sleep last night

This one here goes out to you
Lord, wherever you may be
When you're reaching for the fruit
I pray you'll fondly think of me
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone 'cause I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever lovin' hand
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone 'cause I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever lovin' hand Now God made coal for the men who sold their lives to West Van Lear
And you keep on diggin' 'til you get down there where it's darker than your darkest fears
And that woman in the kitchen she keeps on cookin' but she ain't had meat in years
Just live off bread, live off hope in a pool of a million tears
Now let me tell you somethin' 'bout the gospel
And make sure that you mark it down
When God spoke out ""Let there be light""
He put the first of us in the ground
And well keep on diggin' 'til the comin' of the Lord
And Gabriel's trumpet sounds
'Cause if you ain't minin' for the company boy
There ain't much in this town
We could've made somethin' of ourselves out there if we'd listened to the folks that knew
That coal is gonna bury you
Now it's darker than a dungeon
And it's deeper than a well
So sometimes I imagine
That's gettin' pretty close to hell
And in my darkest hour
I cry out to the Lord
He said ""Keep on minin' boy
'Cause that's why you were born""
Well we could've made somethin' of ourselves out there if we'd listened to the folks that knew
That coal is gonna bury you Don't you wish that you could go back sometimes
Don't you wish that you could go back home
Tryin' to remember just where it was
Remember you ain't alone
Remember you ain't alone
Every day's another pointless job
And every night's another lonesome song
Tryin' to remember when your bed wasn't leather
And you were the one singin' along
Lord, where did we go wrong
Now the sky is coming down
Can't you see the stars fallin'
Have yourself another round
Til' you can't hear the darkness callin'
Til' you can't hear the darkness call you
There was a good man in the makin' once
In the light of yesterday
Tryin' to remember just who he was
Tryin' like hell to recall his name
Well it used to be my name
Now the sky is coming down
Can't you see the stars fallin'
Have yourself another round
Til' you can't hear the darkness callin'
Til' you can't hear the darkness call you You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You see these boots I'm wearing
They're tough enough to go
And they will take many a road to reach you
Honey, won't you light the way?

You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You see this train I'm riding
It's burnin' up the coal
And its wheels are bound to roll right by you
Honey, won't you jump my train?

You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away
You can set my house on fire, baby Bottles and bibles
Litter the floor
An all night revival
Passed out around 4
Now the preacher's been drinkin'
But it's hard not to do
Since she ran out the screen door
And swore they were through
Oh Lord, if you care, send a spirit down here
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again
But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do
He didn't believe her
He just knew she'd come home
But the nights kept a' crawlin'
As he laid there alone
And he'd call up to heaven
And he'd hope and he'd pray
But the line's always busy
Since he went astray
Oh Lord, if you care, won't you answer his prayers
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again
But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do
Now the bottles and bibles
Broke out in a fight
The whiskey fought hard, son
And took the victory that night
They found him a' layin'
Face down by the stairs
Dressed up for a sermon
Nobody would hear
Oh Lord, if you care, send your angels down here
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again
But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do In a small corner bar, he sits there a-drinkin'
Lost as a ball in a field full of corn
Further away than he ever imagined
That he'd ever end up from the place he was born
Now no more forlorn has a Creeker drank whiskey
Than the one that you see out the side of your eye
Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window
At all of the strangers on the corner outside

And he'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this Godforsaken town
When he was a kid, Lord, he'd never a'dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

Now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces
And he knew not the how nor the reason for why
You could ever wake up and wanna keep on a-livin'
In a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find
And for everyone you meet, there's a whole mess of people
Tryin' like hell to pull you on down
To the level they're on and the trouble they're tendin'
In the mess that they've made, in the gutter they found

And he'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this Godforsaken town
When he was a kid, Lord, he'd never a'dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

Some fellas do drugs and things of that nature
Some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm
Some fellas get by on practically nothin'
Some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar

And they'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this Godforsaken town
When they were all kids, Lord, they'd never a'dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down If He knows how it feels to be Beginnin' and the End
I reckon He knows the feelin’ 'tween the now and then
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, friend
Lord, won’t you help me carry my load?
I borrowed me a hammer, I swung it for a dime
I got to where I finally could afford me mine
But in between the swingin' and the idle time
I got to thinkin' heavy on the road

Now I'm hid out in the upper room
With walls so thin, I could bust right through
Give all my buddies a ramblin' to
About the shit that really blows my mind
Back when I was younger, didn't have a clue
Come to think of it, I still doubt I do
But every now and then, I get to thinkin'
""You know, I've got it all worked out""
I used to take my time and burn it in a bong
Iced down with lights turned off
Somethin’ in my speakers I can ponder on
Somethin’ I can mull around

Now I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Check one-two, can y’all hear me?
The sights are somethin', but they ain't for free
Lookin' at ’em, wired for sale

The road goes on forever, party out 'til ten
You'll run forever if ya never let it end
I got a part of me that's wonderin' when
I'll finally kick the urge to roam
A part of me just wants to live forever on the road
Split me down the middle, ship my southpaw home
And if she gets to askin', tell her you don't rightly know
What happened to the rest of me

Aw, weep no more, girl, don't cry
Hellfire, ya married you a Gemini
This is the half of him you always liked
Looky here, his heart still beats He works the night shift at the depot
With a pistol and a light
And he guards them rusty missiles
Counting whitetail to pass the time
And he's worked there for a long while
Since he came home from overseas
Helping Kilcoran fight the good fight
And bring Baghdad to its knees
And it was hotter than the mountain
But it weren't so he couldn't stand
And it weren't so much the heat wave
Nearly as much as all the sand

Now his daddy, he's a log man
With a good leg and a fake
That he got off of a buddy
And a shitshot that he made
And he worked them hands to splinters
And he raised them young'uns right
On a little bit of scripture
And an acreage of paradise
And he'd go out on the weekend
And he played like Clarence White
If Clarence had had a real job
And picked the guitar when there was time

Keeps a trap line in the winter
Keeps a line wet in the spring
On a lock wall, fishing muskie
With his eldest and Steve
And they swap tales about their raisin'
And they tell the awfulest lies
And they go home when they've a notion
And the muskie quit to bitin' Don't hold me
If you don't mean it
'Cause I'm tired of waistin' my time on things set on leavin'
Don't kiss me
If it really hurts you
Though I can't see how you could change after all that we've been through
I reckon it's time for a good thing to wind on down
But it kills me to see
That you don't give a damn about me
Oh I'd die for the chance we could be
Like we were when the summer was right
But you can't bring back days
Or nights that you've done danced away
I keep hopin' that maybe you'll stay
Don't leave me here lonely tonight
In my dreams
We're always laughin'
But I wake up to find that that very rarely happens
So go on and leave me
If it'd really please you
You'll be hard pressed to find you a man that will treat you like I do
But I reckon it's time for a good thing to wind on down
But it kills me to see
That you don't give a damn about me
Oh I'd die for the chance we could be
Like we were when the summer was right
But you can't bring back days
Or nights that you've done danced away
I keep hopin' that maybe you'll stay
Don't leave me here lonely tonight This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me
Tried to kiss her once in the aisle of the bus
And she walked right over me
Face-down in the gum on the floor
I was hopin' that she'd change her mind
But I swear as she walked down the stairs
She didn't even wave goodbye
Didn't even wave goodbye

Ray Dixon didn't take no lip
He'd kick you right off the bus
Stop by your house on the way out of the holler
And tell your momma where you was
He didn't need no driver's aid
To keep a bunch of kids in line
All he needed was a glare in the mirror
And a paddle that he carved from pine
Blisterin' punk kids alive (Oh, blister 'em)

This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me
I held onto hope for eight long years
And by the time that I turned sixteen
I wasn't awkward, I's a real smooth talker
With my very own pickup truck
I'd take her home and if her parents weren't around
She'd bring me in and give me some
Bring me in and give me some

Safe to say nowadays ol' Ray
Can't keep a route very long
And I'm glad the little girl's dad
Never found out what was goin' on
I know he'd kill me in a minute
And he wouldn't have left no trace
Hogs'll eat 'bout anything you give 'em
And they don't let nothin' go to waste
Don't let nothin' go to waste

This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me I was out on a drunk
I was wild enough to shoot at
Too high to hit
Too low to try
Try as I may
Have good intentions
Natural-born heathens
Love backslider's wine

Brothers and sisters
That would be bourbon
That'd be 'bout the furthest
Thing that I need
All my born days
I ain't never been decent
At hidin' the demons
I'm haulin' in me

Too often I reach
For things I know keep me for bein' all that I can
Like a man

There are things I recall
There are things that are hazy
There are things that just shame me
There are things I can't change
Try as I might
Too have good intentions
Natural-born heathens
Love backslidin' ways

Too often I reach
For things I know keep me for being all that I can
Like a man He drinks orange juice and vodka
In the basement while she's talking
To someone long distance for hours and hours on end
And as he’s slowly sippin', he thinks about his children
And the heart attacks that youngest daughter's always giving him
He ain’t smoked no marijuana since he got on with the railroad
And he's been on with the railroad for a long and lonesome while
But the day that he retires, he will smoke himself to China
He will leave behind his worries as he races through the sky

The days are dark down in the holler
Waiting for the sun to shine
On the back you have been breaking
Trying to earn peace of mind

She sells Avon to her buddies and saves a little money
On the makeup she's been using to hide away the years
And she sits and watches TV, usually every evening
If there ain't some kind of ballgame that her daughter has to cheer
She sneaks menthols in the morning while her family's still snoring
And as she burns the Eggos, she looks back at her life
That heart she broke in high school, he's singing on the Opry
She wonders what the hell that she was thinking at the time

The days are dark down in the holler
Waiting for the sun to shine
On the back you have been breaking
Trying to earn peace of mind

Their youngest daughter Stella, she's been running with this fella
That he cannot stand the thought of, that he surely does despise
He's told her he best never see the two of them together
But it’s hard to keep an eye on her
When you’re working all the time
There are things he needs to tend to
And the bills the bank keeps sendin'
Lord, the zeros on the end keep pushing further to the right
Like a freight train hauling sorrow and moving ever onward
Through the tunnel of forever to the never ending light Oh dance with me, junction city queen
Just to hold you would be the greatest thing
Just spinnin' around to the sound of the jukebox so low
And as the time fades, I pray that it goes by slow
Oh sing for me, junction city queen
Well you sound like an angel, so it seems
'Cause everything stops, as we pray you don't go
In the mornin' back to Ohio
But I find myself with empty arms
And a head thats full of dreams
Of my junction city queen
Won't you wait for me, junction city queen?
Well I'm headed that way, and I'm pickin' up steam
And I know for a while I'll be fine until I must leave
And wait for the next time that I see my queen Levi's been in the yard all day
Digging at a mound of snow
See how the winter's taken good ol' boys
And turned 'em into Eskimos
I ain't ever smoked in an Igloo
And I ain't ever seen the 
And I ain't ever spent the harsh of the winter
With a girl that's half as sweet as you

Sally Ann Mountain is mule-faced steep
And covered in a sheet of ice
And we're already here and the fire's warm
So I reckon we should stay the night
Very Old Barton and Guinness on the porch
It's cold enough to keep 'em chill
And for a pair of thieves like you and me
I believe that's a damn good meal

I thought I had it to a science but I never really had a clue
But I never took a quarrel with learning 'bout a thing or two
About a thing as fine as you

Now the wind outside is freezing
And it's howling like a gyp
But I'll hold you close and keep you warm
Against its winter whip

Now the Barton's gone and the snow moved on
And the Dogwood blossoms 
It'd be a shame to waste this flame
Don't let your good love die
You nearly knocked me over
You nearly brought me to my knees
When you turned around at the cabin door
And said, ""Honey will you follow me?""

I thought I had it to a science but I never really had a clue
But I never took a quarrel with learning 'bout a thing or two
About a thing as fine as you Church bells ring at your window and I know that all of these things
Are surely found to be holy in the presence of the Lord
Tell me all that your feeling and I will believe every word
'Cause to think you would speak out in lies
Baby that just sounds ubsurd
And if you want me to go I will
But if you need me to stay baby that'd be a thrill
'Cause tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile
Hold me and tell me you need me
I need you more than you know
'Cause now that I've found what I wanted it's hard to let it go
And the hills have always been home
But now that I've found you the shadows seem cold
And tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile
And if you want me to go I will
But if you need me to stay baby that'd be a thrill
'Cause tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile When the trigger's movin' backwards
And the pin hits the shell
When my soul's sinkin' slowly
To the warm pits of hell
Won't you tell my baby sister
That I'll be back in the fall
'Cause it's better to have false hope
Than no hope at all
And I'll be meetin' with my savior
To go over my foolish deeds
When He asks me why I did it
Lord I'll blame it on the seed
'Cause it didn't grow in like I planned
And when it did it all went dry and
I couldn't stand to hear the pain
Of a small baby cryin'
Well I remember in the graveyard
Well I used to read the names
And I wondered when the Good Lord
Would take my soul away
Well I wonder if he planned it to happen
Like this at all
With a shot heard halfway 'cross the world
And my sins on the wall
And I'll be meetin' with my savior
To go over my foolish deeds
When He asks me why I did it
Lord I'll blame it on the seed
'Cause it didn't grow in like I planned
And when it did it all went dry and
I couldn't stand to hear the pain
Of a small baby cryin'
And they'll tell me I'm a bad man
But they've never seen the sight
Of a baby wailin' in his crib
And rippin' apart the night
It's a small baby cryin' Well it all seemed so happy
But how can that be?
When there's a whole class of people
Just as lonesome as me
You asked me to tell you
How I can be so blue?
But you'd be the same
If the girl of your dreams
Broke your heart in two
So play me a Hank song
To ease my pain
Because it helps to know someone
Felt the same damn way
Alone and forsaken
Brother, what can I say?
I feel like a Hank song
Since she went away
Ol' KG's my buddy
We go way back
To the times back in high school
When I was too poor for Jack
But even he knows that sometimes
You can't help right the wrongs
By gettin' stoned blind
You need to sit down and pine
To a Hank Sr song
So play me a Hank song
To ease my pain
Because it helps to know someone
Felt the same damn way
Alone and forsaken
Brother what can I say?
You know I feel like a Hank song
Since she went away
Well I hope that she's happy
And I hope that she's free
I hope she finds her a man
To treat her like a queen
And then up out of nowhere
When she needs him around
She wakes up to find
She's ran out of time, and he's ran out of town
I hope she needs her a Hank song
To ease her pain
Because it'll help to know someone
Felt the same damn way
Alone and forsaken
Honey what can I say?
I hope you feel like a Hank song
One of these days Lexington's a city
But it ain’t so big it freaks me out
And if I need a breather I can hit the parkway
Be home before the bars all close
And drink away the lies she told
And think about the days

She was a few rides shy of rodeo queen
High school lovin' in a badass Jeep
Far from the eyes of a watchful town
Her mama didn't need to know
Good corn liquor to shake this cold
And good hot lovin’ on a gravel road
Juliet, won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

If push came down to shove
I'd be a bandit for her love
Shoot sharp and walk away
She was good before she changed her name
And I bet that ain't all that's changed
Goddamn, I remember the nights

I was a young punk kid from a dried-up town
Coal-car county full of huntin' hounds
She was the one who kept those boys at bay
Her high heels and my Red Wing boots
Cuttin' couches in the living room
Juliet, won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

I can’t win for all this losin’
I can't see for all this boozin’
But by God, I can keep it together
Just to hold my baby close
Get her movin' down a county road
Make up for lost time

She was a few rides shy of rodeo queen
She ran on sex and gasoline
Far more money than a boy like me could hold
She went off to paint the town
And I'm stuck holdin' these mountains down
Juliet, won’t you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo? If whiskey could talk, it'd say I'm a great guy
Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy
But it's money well spent just to help me feel free
From the pain she creates, when she's cheatin' on me
Well she's at it again, livin' high on the streets
So I reach for the bottle just to help me to sleep
And I lay here in bed and dream of a time
When she was content with being all mine
If whiskey could talk, it'd say I'm a great guy
Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy
But it's money well spent just to help me feel free
From the pain she creates when she's cheatin' on me
She'll come back to me when the lights have gone down
And she's ran out of men to buy her a round
But she dreads comin' home to that drunk in her bed
Who's living alone hangin' on by a thread
If whiskey could talk, it'd say I'm a great guy
Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy
But it's money well spent just to help me feel free
From the pain she creates when she's cheatin' on me Readin' and writin' on Route 23
It's hard to believe we've made it this far
So come on boys and grab your coats
Detroit's waitin' so get in the car
Well the wind it blows cold but the girls are on fire
They say they're the prettiest things you have seen
And I ain't a gambler but I'd bet the farm
That Detroit's a gold mine waiting for me
The sidewalks are always jammed in this town
I feel like a dam that's about to cut loose
And the girls they say, will treat you fine
Beg for your silver 'til you can't refuse
And I'd love to go back to the hills where I was born
Instead of workin' on cars that I can't afford
My pockets are empty my patience is torn
Oh look what's become of me
Mama I'm writin' to tell you I'm fine
I'm workin' real hard and I pray every night
So don't you worry I'm happy and free
Detroit's been like a blessing to me Hair like the sun and eyes just as green
As the ridge line we'd walk, scannin' the trees
For the wave of a tail, a shake of the leaves
Lord, I'd give the whole world for a sight of those things

Hands just as soft as skin on the fruit
That breaks down the branch 'neath the bluest of moons
Lord, we'd eat 'til we's sick and grab all we could hold
Then we'd run through the yard with the fruit that we'd stole

And her love makes me feel like I'm home
Keeps me good comp'ny wherever I go
When I'm smilin', it's her and the banks
The Big Sandy River that colors my face

Love just as strong as Lawrence County shine
It'll mow you right down, it'll make you go blind
I would ruin my life and use up all my pay
Just to have her tonight, just her and the banks

Her love makes me feel like I'm home
Keeps me good comp'ny wherever I go
When I'm smilin', it's her and the banks
The Big Sandy River that colors my face Up in your nephew's room playing on his cousin's guitar
I wrote a song for you
You have done drove off with everything I need
My box and my tumbleweed

I picked it up on the way to Flagstaff years ago
I was hanging on to everything you had the grace to show

You were young and you were hungry
Lord knows I was hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

Looking over the hill at the lights of your hometown
I wrote this song for you
Thinking of the way we met:
A girl home from school and a boy just passing through

I got a job as a cut man at a house just down the road
I had never been to town before and I didn't know a soul

I was young and I was hungry
Lord knows you were hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

Agate white wedding dress
Turquoise on your ring
Upright bass and violin
As you walk the aisle to me

I was young and I was hungry
Lord knows you were hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times Back before birthdays were something she dreads
Back before children had settled her friends
Back when the radio spoke to her heart
Oh girls, they wanna have fun

I lay here awake and I laugh at her jokes
She is referencing movies I'm too young to know
And I'm letting her lead as we dance in the dark
Oh girl, I'm falling in love

Oneida, I know that I'm younger than most
But I'm willing if you've got the time
To buy us some wine
I've played my guitar
I've been workin' on learning that song you've been dying to sing
About weddings and rings
I'll strum in the back
And come in where I can harmonize on a line or two
But this song's all you

Pleading my case with the bro at the door
Buddy, I know we've been through this before
You can't let me go in but if I wait outside
Will you give her a message for me?

Tell her, ""Oneida, I know that I'm younger than most
But I'm willing if you've got the time
To buy us some wine
I'll bring my guitar
I've been workin' on learning that song you've been dying to sing
About weddings and rings
I'll strum in the back
And come in where I can harmonize on a line or two
But this song's all you"" Let's pack our bags and go to Florida for the winter
And meet ourselves some real nice folks
A little on the older side
And little on hope
We'll hold their hands as they walk across the street
Help 'em wipe their goddamn ass
And when they're all fast asleep
Steal their medicine cabinet
Take it back home for the kids to go to school
Make enough damn dough to burn a wet-bank mule
I'm in between jobs with nothing to do
Girl, it's vacation time

It's honest work, I mean it's honestly a hassle
Folks get madder than fire
If they catch you in the witching hour
Trying to steal their copper wire
But if we get it, got a cousin at the scrapyard
Aunt Betty raised a goddamn saint
He always offers top dollar
He's always given me a fair shake
We oughta save a little while we're still around
We oughta keep ourselves busy while we're coming down
And it sure beats diggin' underneath the ground
Savin' vacation time

Ain't hard, I taught Junior how to do it
And he's touched in the head, dark child
Blames it on the drug use, honey
What does he know anyhow?
Takes a little honest work
But pretty much cooks itself
I got a buddy on the mountain having
Trouble keepin' it on the shelf
And if we turn a profit, don't you worry, boo
We'll put a couple good snorts back for me and you
It'll keep you tweakin', keep you going through
'Til we get vacation time Police are piddlin'
Pullin' people over for nothing but a boring night
With nothin' to do
And my eyes are wide
And my hands are kinda shakin' from some trouble that I got into
And my tags are overdue
But honey, I'm goin' home right now

There's tolls both ways
And I'm the only person who came to watch me play last night
I got a cut of the door
It's about this time
I start recalling how my mother said I didn't wanna be an artist
'Cause artists are poor
So buddy, I'm goin' home right now

I got enough gas just to get me back
And I know that she is patiently waitin' on her wanderin' boy
Every time she crosses my mind
My heart goes dancin' like the world is playin' Soldier's Joy
So buddy, I'm goin' home right now

This here's a picture
It's from the  reunion, she is wearing my favorite dress
It makes me a mess
And it's hard on the road
When every mile that I'm driving she is starin' at me from the dash
In my favorite dress
So buddy, I'm goin' home right now

I got enough gas just to get me back
And I know that she is patiently waitin' on her wanderin' boy
Every time she crosses my mind
My heart goes dancin' like the world is playin' Soldier's Joy
So buddy, I'm goin' home right now
Buddy, I'm goin' home right now I was raised in the house of a real holy roller
Warned the people about the ways of sin
He said go out yonder to the water and travel
'Cause disciples they were fishers of men
Yeah disciples they were fishers of men
So I got me a job on the first boat rowin'
And it's been a mighty long time
Since I sat in the house of my father and my mother
Or I seen that woman of mine
Yeah that good lovin' gal of mine
I said babe I'm a-goin' on a little bitty journey
I'll be back when the fishin' is through
While I'm waitin' in case get ready
For when Jesus comes for you
When the Good Lord comes for you
When Jesus comes for you
Here it comes
Sayin' ""Shall we gather by the water
The beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water
That flows from the throne of God""
Truth it lies in the love of a woman
Lord don't sink this boat
I got a pretty little thing waitin' in New Orleans
With a dagger by her throat
She don't wanna do it but she's that crazy
And if I don't make it back
She'll probably die alone and cold
As the creole night turns black
Sayin' ""Shall we gather by the water
The beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water
That flows from the throne of God""
Shall we gather by the water
The beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water
That flows from the throne of God I went to the craft department
For to buy a fake bouquet
I'll love you 'til these flowers die
And they won't die anyway
Their petals, they are made of fabric
Stem is plastic colored green
They don't need no vase of water
Toughest flower you ever seen
Over time they may get dusty
You just brush that dust away
All they need's a little love
I'll love you like a fake bouquet

Sprayed 'em in my Stetson Black
So that you would think of me
Every time you take a whiff
Take a whiff, my honey bee
Bought a card in aisle nine
There ain't nothin' I could say
Hallmark ain't got figured out
Printed up, already made
Cost a bit, but I don't mind
'Cause I ain't got the skills it takes
Nor the time to make a card
To give you with this fake bouquet

Some die off in the July heat
Some die off when the yards all freeze
Plastic flowers hold their bloom
Summer, fall, winter, spring
They don't need no certain climate
For to make their petals stay
All they need's a little love
I'll love you like a fake bouquet
When the man comes down to fetch me
And to take my soul away
You'll still have this cheesy card
And this old faded fake bouquet There's a full moon shining through her bedroom window
Shedding light on them damp and dirty sheets
Hear the floor creak, listen to her heart beat
Louder than a six-string has ever thought to ring
She's a bad sign, Lord, she's a damn sight
Better than a long night sleeping all alone
When the moon makes way to let the day break
Brother, she will leave you strung out on your own

Times get hard
She keeps rising

She's a hot mess
Busting out her sun dress
Leave it for tomorrow
Throw it on the ground
Feel her hips sway
Listen to her eyes say
She don't need a damn thing
Tryin' to weigh her down

Heart of stone
Hotter than fire

She's a heartbreak
Hittin' like a hard rain
Washing out the creek bank
Takin' what she please
Hear her heels click
Leaving like a bad trip
Leaves you feeling breathless
Staggering to your feet I need some money
I need it now
Give me a trunk load
And I'll show you how
We'll take that shinin' in no time
We'll be rollin' in the dough
But you don't take nothin'
Without gettin' bruised
See there's always somethin'
Your bound to lose
And it's usually gone
Before you know
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own
You see all them blue lights?
They ain't your friends
They're bound to get you
But in the end
I'll show you all the tricky curves
And whatt you need to swerve around
But you don't take nothin'
Without gettin' bruised
See there's always somethin'
Your bound to lose
And it's usually gone
Before you know
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own Oh Rosie, Rosie my girl
When our embrace is over
All that's left is the world
It's a mighty cold town
To be wanderin' around
Without Rosie my girl
The floor is about to give way
To the weight of the words
You've been dyin' to say
We could save this house
If you'd just say them now
Oh Rosie my girl
Well silence is a mighty big grave
And whatever goes down there
Is as cold as the plague
Won't you keep me warm?
Tell me what I've down wrong
Oh Rosie my girl I flung the door open and let the heat rise
To  heat up the world 'cause I thought it was mine
And  all the while all of my plants froze inside
'Cause there's only so much to go 'round
It took me some tries and a whole lotta kindling
When  the lesson arrived, it only took me a minute
To  learn there are some things are better off freezing
I can tell you a few that I've found

Hate  is a thing that can poison your veins
And get in your eyes when you're sweating on stage
Shifting around 4 o'clock on the wall
Tell you it's almost over
Vans  that keeps rolling and times for the birds
The chirp in your ears, all the rumors they heard
Flying above all the good in this world
Shitting on cattle and clover

Now when I was a young boy, thought I could track
And an old-timer sat down  me 
And he told me all of the knowledge I lacked
On an ornery ol' thing called a Snipe
He picked me up on a Friday and he dropped me in Charley
Told me when he'd be back and went off to party
And I sat on the hill like a Jeremiah Johnson
And I froze my dumb ass off all night
And that's the way that I feel when I look at our past
And the handshakes you gave me, if you're callin' them that
And the snickers you tried to pass off as laughs
And the way your eyes never met mine

Paranoia's a thing that  sleep
Ain't a thing you recall, ain't a habit you keep
One ol' boy's nightmare is another fool's dream
It's all in the way that you hold her
Hotels are lonely, I reckon I'd know
I've spent many nights in between shows
Watching as paint dries on the wall
On a booger they just painted over

Life reminds me of a card game we played as a kid
Where you laid down the deck 'til you got to the end
Early on there's a joker got lost 'neath the fridge
Over time all the queens moved in with him
And I'd say the boy had him an absolute ball
But he ruined the card game for all us involved
And I let it eat at me like kudzu in Georgia
I hope I don't do that again I remember all them summers
Playing 'til my fingers bled
You'd sing the songs and I'd sing with you
We'd get drunk and go to  bed
Looking back at all them memories
Lord, I hate to sleep alone
But if you ever get the notion
That you need me, let me know

'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord, I love to hear you well
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon

I remember all them winters
Drinking Woodford 'til we drowned
We'd get wind about a party
Bundle up and go to town
Never worry 'bout the police
Never worried much at all
I miss those nights of reckless glory
I'd come back if you'd just call

'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord, I love to hear you well
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon

I left town when we were over
'Cause it didn't feel the same
Every backroad had a memory
And every memory held your name

'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord, I love to hear you well
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon Well call up the reverend
Won't you get him up here now
That old gal won't get to work till every head is bowed
We got new copper wire
She's lookin' pretty nice
And we can't start the courtin'
Till we take it up with Christ

So pray o'er the moonshine still
Pray that the money rolls through them hills
We'll strike gold if it's your will
Just pray o'er the moonshine still

Well mama needs a Maytag
And the babies all need shoes
But at the rate that we are goin'
We'll never see the blues
Our corporations boomin'
Were known both near and far
But if we're gonna reach the masses
We're gonna have to buy a car

But first pray o'er the moonshine still
Pray that the money rolls through them hills
We'll strike gold if it's your will
Just pray o'er the moonshine still

They say that I'm a sinner
They say I'm bound for hell
But I know every baptist boy
And I know them very well
So if I don't reach glory
If I ride that long black train
Well I'll be in good company sippin' moonshine all the way

So pray o'er the moonshine still
Pray that the money rolls through them hills
We'll strike gold if it's your will
Just pray o'er the moonshine still I was meltin' through the box springs
I was dripping on the floor
Watching the dark dance circles
On another hotel door

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about the time I've got
Off the road back home with you

I was hurlin' haymakers
I was swingin' at ceiling fans
Cause and effect and towards
A cold and lonely man

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about the time I've got
Off the road back home with you


Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about the time I've got
Off the road back home with you

Now I'm reachin' for the bottle
While I'm poring over my phone
I'm throwing down the other
As I drain one to the bone

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about the time I've got
Off the road back home with you If you won't pull the trigger
Will you lay that pistol down?
'Cause you're scaring me to death
The way you twirl that thing around
And if you're restless for the highway
She's an easy one to please
Blacktop skin on rubber
You can run her 'til she screams

Oh, but you just 
More than you wanna go
You can't stand the city
And you can't take it here at home

We could bring this town to Jesus
Baptize every hill
And still there'd be some heathens
Who would never get their fill
And yeah, this county's got its demons
But I reckon I got mine
And even if I shook them, Lord
They'd chase me 'cross the line

Oh, but you just 
More than you wanna leave
The city ain't much different, boys
It's just bigger, better streets
Believe me

It takes half a pint of poison
Just to bring you to your feet
Stumble out the back door
And crumble to your knees
And if I gambled like I used to
If I had to point the blame
It wouldn't be that mountain girl
Who stole your heart away

'Cause all you really wanna do
Is 
God almighty, Adam
Won't you leave this town behind
Believe me Well she don't like it when I ain't sober
And I can't say that I blame her
I don't see how she takes it, boys
I don't how she takes it
And she done told me that it's all over
If I walk through the front door
Three sheets to the wind again
Three sheets to the wind
And I just laughed it off
How you gonna get back home?
If you ain't got a dime
And it don't come from me
And that's a long way to walk
And you ain't the ramblin' kind
So I just think it's best
If you decide to stay

Well those mountain women gonna get their way
Or they'll sure die of tryin'
I don't know why she tries so hard
I don't know why she tries
'Cause us mountain fellas are awful stubborn
And we don't give a goddamn
We don't give a damn
No, we just don't care
And we can't get enough
Of all these neon nights
Barroom brawls and bedroom quarrels
And we come home too late
And it ain't nothin' new
And it's just the same ol' thing
And I work way too hard
To take this shit off Jane

Well she went down to the Western Union
Called her country cousin
""I need to get back home right now
I need to get away
'Cause it ain't funny when he ain't sober, honey
Get me on a Greyhound
Get me on a Greyhound home
Get me to the hills""
And I went out one night
Came home when the rooster crowed
And there weren't nothin' left
But the smell of her perfume
Ain't never felt so small
Ain't felt so much pain
And I'm just way too drunk
To take this shit off Jane My love is like the whippoorwill
She bellows out across the hills
Hits me where I need it son, keeps me up at night
She dances cross the threshing floor
O'er the grain till her feet are sore
And the men line up to lay her down
But she don't even see

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

My woman loves just like a train
Eight and the sand through the pourin' rain
Takes a lot to wear her out
Buddy she could run for days
Looks my way and I get weak
Calls my name and I can't speak
Gets me through the loneliness
Takes the blues away

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

My love is like the gospel truth
Puts my hands to proper use
Gets me through the loneliness
Takes the blues away
She dances cross the bedroom floor
Shuts the blinds and locks the door
Always leaves me wantin' more each time she turns away

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go I've ran around
And I've seen a thing or two
Leave that highway black and blue
With the will beneath my feet
And I can tell ya now
Them girls and the whole delight
The way you look tonight, smilin' back at me

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

I got kin
Up north where the wind blows cold
We'll leave tomorrow
Stay drunk for a few good days
When we've spent every dime I've worked to save
We can pack it up
Come back to woodward creek

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

I've got plans
That'll take me far from Irvine
But if I could, Lord knows I'd love to stay
We've got time 'fore I leave these mountains
One more night on the banks of woodward creek

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep I came into town on Sunday and I was lookin' for the Lord
I'd walked all the way from Archer since the day he stole my horse
All them days to get that thing to get on up and ride
And I'll be damned if that old man will get away this time

Now hell is close to Harlan, I believe they're both the same
I fell in love with a Harlan girl that took my breath away
She wanted her a family and that's one thing I can't do
'Cause I was raised to ramble and my ramblin' days ain't through

Some goddamn days out here on these streets
With a pistol in my pocket, boys, it don't bother me
To take you down if you ever cross the line
And I'd run off with your money, you won't need it when you die

Now the road is mighty ornery but it ain't as mean as me
And I've turned into a stranger to the boy who left the creek
But I reckon if I'm lucky that I just might make it home
Get a handle on my , straighten up and die alone

Some goddamn days out here on these streets
With a pistol in my pocket, boys, it don't bother me
To take you down if you ever cross the line
And I'd run off with your money, you won't need it when you die Funny how she calls tonight
I need her more than ever
I've been down in low cotton
As lonesome as can be
And I think about her often, boys
And even when I'm sober
I read over the love notes
The ones she wrote for me

And if she want one night
Well that'd be just fine, well

Somebody fetch my walkin' cane
I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna run to meet her
'Neath the shadow of the pines
She's gonna hop that coal train
She'll get off on Harlan Road
Love me 'til the morning comes
And leave me like a dream

And I'd run to her through tobacco fields
And over 'cross the clover
I'd wade a mile of briar patch, boys
Just to touch her skin
And I reckon I'm the foolish kind
To beckon to her callin'
But I can't seem to help myself
Let that woman win

And if she wants one night
I'm gonna get what's mine, well

Somebody fetch my walkin' cane
I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna run to meet her
'Neath the shadow of the pines
She's gonna hop that coal train
She'll get off on Harlan Road
Love me 'til the morning comes
And leave me like a dream

Buddy, all I know
Is I can't win for losing
Either lay here in this lonely room
Or let her have her way
Buddy, all I need
Is one night where she don't leave
And this one just might be the night
She decides to stay

Somebody fetch my walkin' cane
I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna run to meet her
'Neath the shadow of the pines
She's gonna hop that coal train
She'll get off on Harlan Road
Love me 'til the morning comes
And leave me like a dream
Love me 'til the morning comes  Crazy as hell
And hotter than fire
Brianna, won't you walk my way
Well I'd give you the world if I knew you weren't leavin'
The minute the band stops the music they play
Well I'm drunker than hell
And I'm young and I'm rowdy
I doubt I'll ever change
But I'd give it all up if the good Lord would let me
Stay here forever just watching you sway

But the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

I wish that the stars
Stayed out for ages
I'd sit right in this chair
Watching you dance for the boys and your wages
Lustin' in vain just like every boy here

But the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

When I was just a young boy
My momma told me, son
She said don't go chasin' night owls
Cause they'll leave you when mornin' comes

So the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road        Was it with your eyes
Was it with your tone
It won't leave me alone
Uneasy safety's on
That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said
Crippled up inside
Without a place to hide
I sit and I wait alone
Tryin' to make it
Leave me alone
That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said... That thing you said
Crippled up inside
Without a place to hide
I sit and I wait all alone
Tryin' to make it
Leave me alone
That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said... That thing you said Bring me a beer
Get me to fucked to walk
And I'll crawl out of here
Til the last of my smokes, the last of my tears
She was a freight train made of gold
And she got the high ball and she was ready to go
And she warned me before I took off my boots
She said forevers a word that I seldom use
So I guess I'm to blame
For thinkin' she'd never leave
But I hope and I prayed
That wherever she is lord she thinks about me
Cuz I miss her like the wine
We drank while the fireworks covered the sky
And the radio sang out our tunes
We danced down the hill all the way to my room
So laugh in my face
Tell me that you told me so
But I'll tell you one truth
At least at the time I didn't feel so damn cold
She's a cane break, up in flames
You can't put her out and she burns through the rain
And she warned me before I took off my boots
She said forevers a word that I seldom use
So, bring me a beer
Get me to fucked to walk
And I'll crawl out of here
Til the last of my smokes"
