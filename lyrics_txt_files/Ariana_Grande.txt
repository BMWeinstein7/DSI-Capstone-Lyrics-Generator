Hey, ayy, oh yeah… Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able

Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Thought you were somebody else, you (You)
Thought you were somebody else, you This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight Mmm, last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
Mmm, you're such a dream to me

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

""Excuse me, um, I love you""
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: ""I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me, mmm, yeah I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play and I'll roll the dice, hey

Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move

Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac shook her

Then the mood change, then my name change
From 'Lil Wayne' to ""Ooh, Wayne,"" oh Lord

Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything

I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby

I'm stronger than I've been before (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is (This is) the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know ""sorry"" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

Ooh, hmm, ha, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are

Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'

Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin' ’til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin’ 'til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside
I don't care who is listening
'Cause they be making fun of this on TV
They wouldn’t laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me

Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go, oh

You got it, you got it, babe (Got it, huh?)
You got it, you got it, babe (Sean Don!)
You got it, you got it, babe

Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? (Got you, I got you)
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

You know what I need (Ayy)
I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Hey)
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh

You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (Right there)
Right there (Right there)

You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

You got it, you got it, babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it, you got it, babe, yeah (Put your hands up, put your hands up)

And I get butterflies just thinking
About you, boy, you're on my mind (My mind)
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time (Track of time)

You know what I need (Ayy)

I'll always be right there (What?)

Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (So swear)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go (I got you)

You should know (Oh) I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)

Got it, babe Oh, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah

I've been thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (About you, baby)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you, ah)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I'm thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Say you don't, baby, 'bout you)

Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I do)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh; Oh, yeah)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful

I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful

It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you, boy

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go (Oh, yeah, baby)
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (Ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (Oh, yeah)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind (Baby)
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go (No, boy)
Not even sometimes

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Not even sometimes
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her

And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only

But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit, oh-oh, ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

Oh, babe
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit, my baby)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for Dangerous love
You're no good for me, darling
Yeah, you turn me away
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me
I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me, baby, more

Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried?
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?

So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

You're a dangerous love

Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin' ""Baby, don't worry""

And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine

Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?

Goodbye, goodbye

Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's no one around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one

Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened

Too much for me to mess this up

My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey, yo

Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey Oh-oh-oh-oh

Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance

I just wanna welcome you to Christmas
Let me sneak into your speakers, listen
I'll be singing, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh""
I'll be singing, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh"" Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

My love Santa baby, slip a Sable under the tree for me (mmhmm)
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed *kiss*
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, the one little thing I really need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Waiting
Hurry, tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight It's The Rascals!

Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love? Baby loves, I'm tryna to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
Think I'd rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's lookin' at it too
And I don't know what to do I told you once, ""Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright""
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
""I miss you more every day""
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things like ""Shut up and kiss me""
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
""I miss you more every day""
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things like ""Shut up and kiss me""
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body

When I wake up early, I'ma text ya

You could pull me in, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky
Looking up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie

For the night, everything's alright

Is making me feel things I don't know, know, know
Boy, you make me feel so good

I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it

Oh, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

And nothing less, I promise
Love me and don't look back
I want you with me on this road to the sky
We'll be shining every night, I promise you
Just me and you
Oh, I promise you Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away, away from me

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year can you...

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh yeah
This year can you...

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

I know I'm asking for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California Lyrics for this song have yet to be released I want you (Oh)
I want you (Oh)

You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show
I-woah-woah-woah

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise

But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, I want you, oh, I want you, oh, I want you Lyrics from Snippet

You got me all up in my feels
In all kind of ways

No more playin' safe
Let's take it all the way
I'm just sayin'

I just wanna make time for ya
Swear it's just right for ya

Ten outta five on ya
Know I would stand on the line for ya
Bet I look nice on you (Yeah)
Open my mind for ya (Yeah)

Don't wanna wait on it, tonight I wanna get nasty (Yeah, yeah)
What you waitin' for? (What you waitin' for?)
What you waitin' for? Every day I'm grinding
I don't even get a weekend
I've been living my life in black and white, no sleeping
So tonight we're gonna flip it
Like in a New York minute
We're gonna hail a cab and don't look back once we get in it

Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop, like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty, in a pink champagne
Let 'em know our names
Screaming so loud, they'll hear us in L.A
We're popping, like pink champagne (aye, aye)
Popping, like pink champagne (aye, aye)
Popping, like pink champagne

Make it pop like, make it pop like
Make it pop like, make it pop like, make it pop like

We don't need no guest list, everybody's invited
I'm saying, ""Even if you can't get in, we'll dance outside it""
We're gonna make this bubble
We'll carbonate some trouble
When the line gets flat, gotta take it back to another level

Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop, like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty, in a pink champagne
Let 'em know our names
Screaming so loud, they'll hear us in L.A
We're popping, like pink champagne (aye, aye)
Popping, like pink champagne (aye, aye)
Popping, like pink champagne

Make it pop like, make it pop like
Make it pop like, make it pop like, make it pop like

Make it pop like, make it pop like

Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?

You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it

No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

Don't throw your heart out in a letter
Cause I already read your mind
You know you missed out on forever
And settled for a waste of time

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it

No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it

Say, I’m thinking ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain’t a player, I just—
You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

So don't you worry, te necesito

Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking up to strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get the up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of mind, like

Can't resurrect Ghandi, resurrect King
But if put our heads together we can do anything

Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Don't let it bring you down, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
Sing it if you're with me
All you boys and all you girls
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little bit of love maybe we can change the world Where do you turn?
When there’s no one to turn to?
When it's so hard to cope
How can you start to make a change?
Maybe learn to
What do you need?
(Hope)

Hope is the song
When the world is a menace
Hope is an open door
Maybe getting back up again is
What falls are for Tell me why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?

Stopped, thinking like a victim
Climbed out the bodybag
Now I'm on the attack
Caught you dreaming Hercules
Hercules

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

When he smiled, the girls went wild with (""oohs"" and ""aahs"")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every ""vahse""
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the glad in gladiator?
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
(Hercules!)
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
(Hercules, Hercules)
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero

And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in my trunk

I'm gonna witch you

My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine

Strong, and wise, and sweet, and quiet

Feelin's grow over time
Diamonds go over time

(Give love, love, love, love…) Jamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon

And I'm still hurting

Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine

And I'm still hurting

What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?

Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide

And I'm still hurting

Go and hide and run away
Runaway, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Runaway like it's simple
Like it's right


Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn

But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked

And I'm still hurting Snippet
Sober, when you come closer
Boy I know I know you've been trying to quit
But you let it show

Boy we're kissing now
Baby when I'm with you
I'm wasted Higher... uh huh

Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

Only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I fell this spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doing- living, letting go (go, go)
Riding, having good times and no one has to know
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I fell this spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, mmhmm
We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, oh yeah
We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, uh huh
We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds yeah, yeah, yeah

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher Let's do what we want
That shit's beautiful
Just stay where we are
Right here in the moment
Let's do what we want
That shit's beautiful
Just stay where we are
Right here in the moment

I know we just met but... If I'm honest, I wasn’t devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we’re getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(Just like mine, versions of these belong to you)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(Just like me)
They long to be close to you Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
Yeah, yeah
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This lovesick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh...
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me...
And I'm back

Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Yeah, yeah
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

Basically I’m saying here
I can’t live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah
Ain’t no need for contemplating
Promise you won’t keep me waiting
Tell me baby I’m all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

If I could die
(I’mma make you believe boy)
I wouldn't mind
Ay, ay, oooh
Don't stop baby, no no oh!
It's what you do to me, yeah
Wooh, no no no no no no
Oooh
If I could just die
Oooh
Baby please don't go boy
No no no no no no Lyrics from Snippet:

He will if you won't get you a jada (Get you a jada)
Be there when I get home now
I don't know, what you've been told
But you should know—

That you don't fuck around with me
That you don't fuck around with me I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream...

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning, when I rise
You are the first thing, on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above Do you love me? (Do you love me?)

Bust a move, get in the groove
Baby girl, I'm into you
Show me what you can do
I got you, boom
You're feeling some new

Tell me if it's meant to be

On the dance floor, I'm Michael Jackson
Time for some action, here we go
Sky Blu in the stereo
Turn it up, hurry up
She doing it Grande, that's what's up
Her plus me, you can add it up
Oh, you'll never get enough of that

Tell me if it's meant to be

I turn into something better than I am
I forget just where I end and you begin
Baby, I'm the only one that gave a damn
So take my hand

I wanna run
We could run like waterfalls and chase the sun
We could stay up late, so faded and get done
Baby, you're the only one I wanna love
So let's run

My fingertips trace the silhouette of your skin
And your lips taste like heaven but I'll taste them with gin
Body touch, won't you understand
In your hands
I'm in your hands


You're the paint, I'm the canvas
Gonna be just what I am
I'll be every masterpiece you ever made
I know I'm risky, I'm the risk you wanna take
Ain't no mistake

My fingertips trace the silhouette of your skin
And your lips taste like heaven but I'll taste them with gin
Body touch, won't you understand
In your hands
I'm in your hands I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
Tú eres todo para mí
Te amo, I love it

Yo no soy perro, soy canino
Solo trátame con cariño
Este amor es como el vino
Entre más viejo pues más fino
Aunque a tu madre no le gusten mis tatuajes
Dile que soy yo quien te saca lo salvaje
You give me that kind of somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
And I ain’t goin' nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

So don’t you worry, te necesito
I, I got a bad boy, just admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, no sé vivir (Tú eres todo para mí)
Ooh, no sé vivir, the way I love you (Te amo, I love it)

Oh, estoy loca, no, no, no, no puedo
Ya dejarte de pensar
Y tú me llevas hasta el cielo (El cielo)
Con tu modo de hablar

Dame un beso, mi amor, y acaríciame
Llévame al cielo, enamórame
Baby, yo quiero (Estar contigo)
No te vayas, escucha lo que digo

So don’t you worry, te necesito
I, I got a bad boy, just admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

I love the way (I love the way you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, no sé vivir (Tú eres todo para mí)
Ooh, no sé vivir, no sé vivir, no (Te amo, I love it)

Yo soy diferente, no sigo al resto de la gente
No sé si estoy bien loco o si soy inteligente
Solo que con tu amor es más que suficiente
Y por ti viajaría todo el continente
Baby, ven aquí por favor
Sabes que aquí estoy yo
Ven y no pierdas tiempo
J Balvin, man

So don’t you worry, te necesito
I, I got a bad boy, just admit it (Hey)

Te amo, te amo (Colombia la casa, Latino stand up)
I love the way you make me feel (Te amo)
No sé vivir, the way I love you (Let's go) I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy, I couldn't give it to you

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Sans toi, plus rien ne brille, plus aucun rêve ne me tient debout

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

Tout seul je dérive
Si de ta peau tu me prives
Les minutes sont des années
Quand le cœur se laisse aller
Viens, on recommence
On s'accorde une deuxième chance
Rattrapons le temps gâché
Arrêtons de nous cacher
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
J'pourrais changer d'avis mais tu resteras mon seul amour

And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby

Oui, attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantôme (juste un fantôme)
Attends-moi
Sans toi, je suis sans vie, sans idéaux
Je sais qu'on ne peut jamais remonter le temps
Pourquoi ne pas s'apprendre à s'aimer au présent ?
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantôme

I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah...
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you (oh...)
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (who takes you home, babe!)
One more time (oh yeah)
I promise after that, I'll let you go (I promise that, I'll let you go)
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms, oh!
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah (ooh!)

Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantôme I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking

With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

Migo
We're gonna be alright I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose

Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere
That you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere
Draw the bridge behind me

Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
'Cause tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh yeah, when you're, when you're gone
Oh yeah, yeah, when you're gone

Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old

See upon a ball of fire out in space
Zooming up behind me
All the wondering on your face
Was there inside me

Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
Tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh, oh, when you're, when you're gone
Oh, oh, when you're gone

Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me

Hi On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie Yeah!
I heard a couple of bad things when you were with me
I used to think it was gossip I shouldn't believe, my bae
And I was going around thinking you were my baby (Oh, yeah)
Boy, you were taking the sugar from every lady (Oh, yeah)

Oh, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

All of my ladies will hit me up saying (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You better open your eyes, girl
Your boy's been playing (You know)
Oh yeah
And even though on the outside, you're looking so tasty (Oooh yeah)
Well baby boy, on the inside you're nothing but shady
Na na na na na na

Boy, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

Yeah There's a dangerous love, boy
You're no good for me, darling

Danger, baby

I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me darlin'

Danger, danger, dangerous darlin'

Ariana, Iyaz

Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on, and ring, ring, ring, yeah)
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid (yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha you say, boy?

You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)

Every day and night you've got an open invitation, (whoa)
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me
I'll be your fantasy, (woo)
You're in demand, but baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak
I'll have to tell you ""bye, bye""
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy?
(Woo)

You're my only shorty
(Am I your only?)
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
(Am I your only?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)

See, yeah, back in the day, I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (same old)
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave (oh)
I don't need to bring in all the attention (hey, yeah)
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Baby, come clean)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)

Am I your only?
Am I your only?
(Yeah)
Tell me, am I your only shawty?
(Yes, you are)
Why won't you say that?
(Yes, you are)
Am I your only shawty? And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, ""You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you""
But I wanna be in your arms
They say, ""No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home""
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

When you said, ""Baby, I just want you to lay me down and we'll fuck the pain away""
'Cause skin on skin, I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay

We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice, so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

I can't quit you
I can't quit you, oh, baby
I can't quit you
I can't quit you, oh, babe
Gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I'm gonna regret it
I'm gonna regret it
Gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it A-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh (a-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh)

You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like ""I before E, except after C""
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

Or simple as do-re-mi

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an ""A"" (how to get an ""A"")
Spell ""me"" and ""you"" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby
1, 2, 3, baby
A, B, C, baby
Do-re-mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

A, B, C

Baby, you and me If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that
Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love

I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming ""Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out""

(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: ""You're in love"")

You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)

Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)
(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh) It's Iggy Iggs
Soy J Balvin, man
One less, one less problem

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí (Ooh, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh, woah)
I got one less, one less problem

Okay, it's Iggy Iggs
La familia, uh, leggo
Ha, soy J Balvin, man (Uh-huh)
Sí, sí, el periódico de ayer
¡El que desechaste, eh!
Y ahora vienes a rogarme, ¿qué?
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
¿Recuerdas cómo de mi tu te reías?
Ahora me buscas en la calle todo el día
Recuerdas cómo a mí me maldecías?
Y ahora viajo en Jet privado con las mías

One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders

La Vie en rose Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y
And so I'm offering this simple phra-ay-ay-ase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you There you come with your big, brown eyes and I'm so sure you got me mesmerized
So sure I'm just about to fall for you
But you don't even try and catch me, so I

I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Boy, you might be falling but I think I better not
My heart's still mine
I'm gonna take my time, but

Don't leave cause there's something about me and you
You gotta stick around, stick around around
Oh, You gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found
You gotta stick around

Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me
I've always been the kind to think things out
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about
So I

I make my mind up, I make my mind up
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so
Wait a minute

Till I got you all figured out
You gotta stick around, stick around, around
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around
Take a look, take a breath
Take a chance on everything I've said
Take your heart. And take your time
And maybe one day you'll be mine
Ohh, maybe one day you'll be mine. (Woah)
Yeah!
You gotta stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hang round' if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
Stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hand 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love, baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around
There you come with your big brown eyes and I'm
So sure you've got me mesmerized
Stick around Share my life
Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh, ooo yea Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned! I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same
Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes
Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)
Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore
Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone Oh yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, mmm oh yeah

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away, oh

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yores
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more, ooh

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask, cause
What you don't understand is I'd

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ohh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

You wouldn't do the same

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said ""hey"" when you get back to where you're from
Mad boy, bad boy, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face and rip the brakes out my car

I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I'd ever ask, cause
What you don't understand is I'd

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ohh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darlin', I'd still

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ohh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

You wouldn't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you wouldn't do the same
Oh, no, no, no What it will be it will be
I let it rain
Why was your whole life fulfilled
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Well I think it's getting dark out baby
No thanks I don't need your yellow umbrella ever right now
Ah, oh, ah, oh
Well you better get in the car
Could you move on
I can't wait for the skies to open up its heart
And let it rain
Let the sun shine down on me
I let it rain
Because you gotta deal with it anyway
I let it rain
What it will be it will be
I let it rain
Why was your life so fulfilled
I let it rain (Imma let it rain, yeah)
Let the sun shine down on me
I let it rain
Because you gotta deal with it anyway
I let it rain (I let it rain)
What it will be it will be
I let it rain (oh let it rain)
Why was your whole life fulfilled Lyrics From Snippet

Oh darlin', I’ve been working too much
I’ve been thinking bout your touch
T-Turn it on and hit me up
And I want ya...

Oh darlin', I've been in and out of town
I've been missin' you around
Won't you come and see me now
Oh darlin', I've been missing...

Wanna kiss you... miss you, gotta keep up Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released TBA When raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried
An angel cried, she cried I know you want what's best for me
I know you've been waiting patiently
You got my hand over the fire
I know you wanna take me higher

I don't wanna jump until I'm sure
It's not like my heart is insecure
The moment I'm ready
I'll just know it
I'm gonna know it

Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby, not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

You make it hard, boy to resist
A little more space
I must insist
Too close
You're intoxicating
Makes me wonder why I'm waiting

I'll give up the fight
When I know it's right
Baby, baby, not tonight
Oh oh, a little more time
And I'll take you there

Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time
And I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not today
But love
Come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

Only time can tell me if this is real
Or if we're rushing how we feel
Is it my imagination?
Is it a perfect situation?
No
I didn't wanna fall in love
But you made me go and do it
And now you gotta prove it
A little more time and I'll take you there

Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there
Baby, not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time
And I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time and I'll take you there

And I'm gonna take you there
And I'm gonna take you there
And I'm gonna take you there
And I'm gonna take you there
A little more time and I'll take you there Get so high
Go so fast
It's getting good
I wanna make it last
Spinning round
Soaring Free
Steady now your gonna make me scream and shout
Tryin land it's rushing down
But light and sound is spinning round
Tryin land it's pouring out
You make me want to scream and shout
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You make
You make
You make me go round
You make me
You make
Go round I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (It's never enough, babe)
So close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enough I was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

Io coi jeans sempre uguali
Tu giacca Armani
Le firme sui muri
Tu capi firmati
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Tu i viaggi, i regali, le fedi nuziali
Noi al massimo a scambiarci le fedine penali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Mai stato un tipo da spiaggia o da bagnasciuga
Meglio l’uomo con l’uccello che con la tartaruga
Il tuo capo è firmato il mio capo è incazzato
Il tuo capo è firmato il mio capo è incazzato
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby
Io sono diventato quello che hai sempre odiato
E sono diventato quello che hai sempre amato

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah...
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't want to be without you

So one last time (oh one last time!)
I need to be the one who takes you home (who takes you home, babe!)
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go (I promise that, I'll let you go)
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms, oh!
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah (ooh!)

One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side


Got me walkin’ side to side

Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side So, nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
So where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
So deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

So somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
So where were you when I needed you the most?
Why in the hell would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
So now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess Yo, I was the baddest bitch that you ever had
Edition Limited, the Barbie is never mad
I was the baddest bitch you that ever had
Sons come get your dad cause he gone suffer bad

Ayo, trophy wife, out, you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
No-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (Ooh)
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak (Now, now)
Now he shooting his shot like drive-by
Why-why-why you had to make me go call up my side guy?
Ca-ca-can't let a f-boy eff up my nice vibes
Yo, Ariana, come let me give you a high five

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down I don't wanna be, to be alone, baby
Unless I'm alone, unless I'm alone with ya
Cause it won't be, cause it won't be
Cause it won't be, cause it won't
I hold you close, I hold you close, darling
The way that I use to, the way that I use to
Cause it won't be, cause it won't be
Cause it won't be, cause it won't...

There's people on the sidewalk, there's music in the air
Everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do
Cause all I want for Christmas, is Christmas time with you
I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby, say you'll be coming home

I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
Unless I'm alone with you

Sittin' by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms
Keep from the cold night, you'll be safe and warm
We raise a glass together, to love that never dies
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes
There's no better time to be together
There's no sadder time to be alone
Hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true

I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
Unless I'm alone with you

I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby, say you'll be coming home
Coming home

I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas... ""When will people stop being offended by women showing skin / expressing sexuality? Men take their shirts off / express their sexuality onstage, in videos, on Instagram, anywhere they want to… All. The. Time. The double standard is so boring and exhausting. With all due respect, i think it's time you get your head out of your ass.  Women can love their bodies too!!""
– responding to a commenter who said she was ""like a whore"" in her ""Dangerous Woman"" video, on Facebook
""The incredible double standard that we  face on a daily basis, in the industry and just in the world, it's shocking. I would be so amused, and pardon me if this comes across as sexist, but I don't think a male artist would be in this position right now. Sorry. If i'm speaking about something that I'm passionate about, I'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what I believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that I will always be one of the first to speak up about.""
""Is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between? … Is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between? … You need a little brushing up on equality over here.""
""I have a long list of things I'd like to change … I think, judgement in general. Intolerance, meanness, double standards, misogyny, racism, sexism. You know, all that shit. There's lots we've got to get started on. That's what we need to focus on. We've got work to do.""
– responding to the question ""If you could use makeup or your phone one last time, what would you pick?"" on California's Power 106 FM
""I'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy, I'm not Big Sean's ex, I'm not Niall's new possible girl. I'm Ariana Grande.""
– to The Sun
""What I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I … do not. Belong. To Anyone. But myself. And neither do you … I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating/ married/ attached to, having sex with (or not)/ seen with … but by their value as an individual. ""
"" are so ignorant sometimes. Stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies. It's okay to be different ... to be curvy or to be thin. When did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies? We were having fun! Dancing on stage. 'What's she shaking tho???' I'm shaking my pretty, cute, petite ass next to Nicki's pretty big booty. Both are f---ing awesome. How about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are? That  be nice. So tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down.""
– on Instagram
""Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled 'After Black Power, Women's Liberation' and 46 years later … we're still not quite there yet! If a woman has lots of sex (or any sex for that matter) … she's a 'slut.' If a man has sex … HE'S. A. STUD. A BOSSSSSS. A KING. If a woman even talks about sex openly … she is shamed! But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used 'bitches'/‘hoes' … how lovely) he's had … he is regaled.

I want you to love me, like I'm a hot ride
Be thinkin' of me, doin' what you like
So boy, forget about the world
’Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it
Then I'mma make you swallow your pride
Oooohhh

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like I'm the only one that's in command
’Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one...

Want you to take it like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin', you can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', be my prisoner for the night
Oooohhh

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like I'm the only one that's in command
’Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one...

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Make it last all night

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like I'm the only one that's in command
’Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one... You brought me up to my melting point
And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win
When you wear me out and you spread me thin
Oh, oh
It’s like you’re only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling, you’ll be packed up and be gone
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
I know I did it all for love
Started strong without a care
And as time went on you left me bare
Oh, oh, blinded by your faulty truth
It didn’t take me long to see through you
Oh, oh
It’s like you’re only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling you’ll be packed up and be gone
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
I know I did it all for love
I took off too fast
I jumped overboard
I would have finished last
So I, I’m shoving you down
There’s nothing I need
When you’re around
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
I know I did it all for love Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now

How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of...

Just for now, just for now... I thought that I was a hopeless romantic
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic
I really thought that I'd be like my grandparents
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic Note: An asterisk (*) next to a song title denotes that the song title has not been officially confirmed.

Z ""The first line of 'Focus' is: 'I know what I came to do and that ain't gonna change.' What I came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love, to share, to listen, to improve, to learn, to share music, to share experience, to share feelings, to make people feel happy and empowered,"" she explained.
""To make people feel like they're not alone. Without using my voice to do those things I would feel empty,"" she continued. ""When I say 'focus on me' I'm not asking to be the center of attention. I'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice. By 'focus on me,' I literally mean focus on me. Focus on what I'm all about and what I believe in.
""The more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like, what we're wearing, our gender, our hairstyle, our sexuality, the color of our skin. But focus on each other on a soul level. The more we realize how much we have in common, the more we listen to each other, the more one we become.""
The title of Ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her, too, since she's had such a tumultuous year (ahem, remember the donut incident?), but she insists this is about all of us.
""You judge because you don't focus on me, you don't focus on each other,"" she explained. ""You judge because you focus on appearance, on clothes. You focus on what you want from me, what you want from people. How you want them to wear their hair. You judge me, you wanna see me dressed a certain way, how you wanna see their make-up, their eyebrows. You focus on what you think people should be like for you. But when you stop and you actually focus on someone, you'll see the light in them. When you focus on me, you see the light in me. When we focus on each other, we see the light in each other. And even if you don't, this is who we are. What are we making fun of? What's there to make fun of? We should apologize for that."" I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

Tell me what you came here for
'cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
('cause I'm so into you)

This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right

Tell me what you came here for
'cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body

So come light me up (yeah, into you)
Little dangerous (yeah, into you)
Little dangerous (yeah, into you)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it

A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you

A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it

So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you So the news is out about Sam & Cat. I felt it wasn’t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are…. I think that’s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good
I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character (and she is) but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book…… she wouldn’t judge anybody by their appearance…. she believed the best in people…. she wasn’t afraid of anything or anybody…. she never let people’s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted… she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real (which is something I personally do all the time but I wish I could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does)
One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that’s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way
So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some ‘dumb’ kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us
Hopefully we’ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I’d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They’d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)
Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn’t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can’t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted
Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started… you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We’ve been through so much and you are still here… and we’ve got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever Ennuí mon amí
I know the problem look colossal
But if you can see me
How bad can things be?

What do you do
When the barrel that carries you
Suddenly harries you
Stick together
What do you do when the bolt in the wood parts
Turn into no good parts
Stick together

Stay, stay sag an droop an drag
An rivets wear an tearsome
But we can still repair some

Now you try
My oh my

What should you do when you stuck on the drain
You should sing this refrain, stick together
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy

Now we pour a square
There there
Where?
There

What should you do when your favorite comes
Needing repairs
Sing together
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy
Spiffy riffy, fix in jiffy

Make mistakes
For heavens sakes
We all commit the past friends
Let's fix that  nose friend
And a whole lot of doing

Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushy flingy
Easy peasy bottle squeezy...
Dingy dingy brushy flingy...

Baby Loves:
Baby loves, I'm tryin' to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'll rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll a dice, hey
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
(woo, oh, oh, oh)
Before I make a move
(woo, oh, oh, oh)
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
This could take some time, hey
I made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
(woo, oh, oh, oh)
Before I make a move
(woo, oh, oh, oh)
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Tell me what you came here for?
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
So come light me up, so come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous, a little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a little more ""touch my body""
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and
I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy

(somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
(somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you) Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard babe to sleep at night

Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms and holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
Promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything

Cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights

Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you’re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go, I got you

You should know I’m never gonna change (I’m never gonna change)
I’m always gonna stay (I’m always gonna stay)
You call for me, I’m right there (I'm right there)
Right there (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there Know my love, infinite, nothing that I won't do But it was all in my head
Yeah

Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin' and able

Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
Hmm, I thought that you were the one
But it was all in my—
Painted a picture

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
So maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Thought you were somebody else, you (You)
Thought you were somebody else, you
Yeah There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your **** bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do (huh)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told (huh)
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn (yeah)
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (ah)

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling (feeling...)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party

Okay,  this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy,  you make me feel so lucky

And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill
So, don’t get mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you better tell me, tell me
You’ll never know
Boy, you coulda let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don’t understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause

Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O

I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river (Want you to cry me)

Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it

He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo

         I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' (don't think 'bout nothin)
I'm comin' at ya
Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' (don't think 'bout nothin)

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all night
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side

Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me (know you got me)
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all night
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side

All these bitches' flows is my mini-me
Body smoking, so they call me Young Nicki Chimney
Rappers in they feelings, 'cause they feelin' me
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany
Curry with the shot, just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
Gun pop and I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give him up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy (boy), got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night (been here all night)
I've been here all day (ooh, baby)
And boy (no), got me walkin' side to side
Yeah Why can't I make this shit last
On top of everything, it's all new
I could be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole body buzzing, feel it in yo- I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should’ve fought it
At least I’m being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should’ve done you better
'Cause you don’t want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don’t deserve it
I know I don’t deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I’ll swear I’ll make it worth it
Can’t you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, hey
Just stay with me a minute
I swear I’ll make it worth it, yeah
(Oh, one last time)
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, hey
(Take you home, babe)
Just stay with me a minute
I swear I’ll make it worth it, yeah

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time

I got one more problem with you girl, hey!

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)
Problem, problem, problem
(I got one less, one less problem)
Let's go

I know you're never gonna wake up

Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know
But I really, really doubt you understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what

One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya (hey)

(I got one less, one less problem) Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, my air
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, yeah

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I keep on breathin', oh, yeah
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go

Hey
Hey

You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you're on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go

You should know I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay)
You call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

I'll always be right there Bright smile that always glows
Pearly whites with a button nose
And I knows, everyone’s gonna love me now
Life on a the street  is a nail on the head
It's better than fixing the  roofing instead
The crowd will be packed, and they’ll probably sing along
What a girl. What  a nice face, This is my song
I'm the biggest bang with the mostest zing
If you're the hand I'm the diamond ring
By the way, I'm even  the song and the dance
So give me one, give me one

         I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (it's not hard)
It's not hard, (It's not hard)
And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was mastered
By love (by love)
It's so hard (So hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)
But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (It's not hard)
So hard (So hard)
Real hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling boy
And how I'm doing shit my way
If I got my piano, then I know I'd be okay, baby
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle

It's not hard (It's not hard)

It's not hard Being ""empowered""...... is not the same as being a ""bitch""...
HAVING SOMETHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDE....
what I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.
I have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORE. to talk about. I'm currently making the best music I've ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people I've ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.
I come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.
Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled ""After Black Power, Women's Liberation"".... and 46 years later... we're still not quite there yet!
If a women has a lot of sex (or any sex for that matter).... she's a ""slut"".
If a man has sex..... HE'S. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.
If a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!
But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used ""bitches""/""hoes""... how lovely) he's had... he is regaled.
If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!
If a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. ""AWW SHIIIT HE SMASHED!!!1!!1!"".
I know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.
I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to, having sex with (or not) / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.
I want the people reading this to know that they are MORE THAN enough on their own.
I want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.
I'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that that's just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. I've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.
One more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things I've done / things I'm going through. I don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love y'all with all my heart.... you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.
""any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood."" - Gloria Steinem Released in 2019 Ladies in the buildin'

(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
('cause I'm so into you)
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
('cause I'm so into you)

         How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mmm)
When you're not really there? (Ah, yeah, mmm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in
Ooh yeah
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Oh, ayy)
Baby, let's just forget (Ooh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?

Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall
Baby, let's fall
Baby, let's fall in love

I just broke up with my ex
Now I’m out here single, I don’t really know what’s next
But I ain’t even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I’m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don’t normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

Been friends for a minute
So you know just what I like
You know my mind
Even seen boys come and go
So you know what makes me cry
See, you're the one that treat me right


(You're no good, but it's time I love you, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(But it's time I love you, yeah, yeah, ah)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(I'm looking for love)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(You're looking for love baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(I'm looking for love babe)
She's just looking for love
She's just looking for love All I need is to see your face

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, ooh
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

And just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mm

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, ooh
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, my air
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, yeah
All I need is to see your face

         I was a liar
I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar (come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh, woah)
(I got one less, one less problem)

It's Iggy Iggs!
Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know
But I really, really doubt you understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what

One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

Hey
No, babe
Ooh
I got one less, one less problem
Baby

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (Woo, hey!)
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem, problem)
One less problem without ya (Hey)
I got one less, one less, yeah
(I got one less, one less problem) 'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...)

Hey, hey

Got to love me harder

I love you more than anything

I'm getting a little crazy
I cannot express
I retire
I can't explain how I feel
And I say love love
Oh love my love
Oh love
Love
Oh I'm trying to say that you are my everything
But every time I try to say they just copulate
And I say love love
Love I've never felt that way before
What I feel about you is unique
Keep, I belong to you
If possible
To tell you i love you so much
Words are not enough
Oh love my love
Oh love love
Oh I'm trying to tell you that you are my everything
But every time I try to tell you
They just get complicated
And I say love
Oh love
Love
Love

Every time I try to tell you that you are my everything
They just get complicated
Every time I try to tell you that you are my everything
They just get complicated
Oh love my love

I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
I can't resist it no more, more, more, more
I can't resist it no more, more, more
I'm stronger than I've been before
Break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
I'm stronger than I've been before

Break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
I can't resist it no more
I'm stronger than I've been before
Break free

This is the part when I break free
I can't resist it no more
I can't resist it no more, more Slow down, you crazy child
You're  so ambitious for a juvenile
But  then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd  better cool it off before you burn it out
You've  got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day
But  you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you get old
You're gonna kick off before you even
Get halfway through
When  will you realize, Vienna waits for you
Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. you're right
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you? Why the why, why, why?
Why you always get off on the fly
All the shit gets in my way
And makes it harder for me

Leave me on you, then you move
It fucks up what we're tryna fuckin' do
Have you ever met a bad bitch?
Shakin' hands with fuckin' savage
Lay down, then you get up
You fucked up what I'm tryna fuckin' do
Have you ever met a good girl?
Shakin' hands with the devil

You realize everything you do
Makes it harder for me
Won't lie, tellin' the truth
You're tryna make it harder for me

Make it harder for me
Why you try to make it harder for me?
Fuck what you see, babe
Fuck it, why you try to make it fuckin' harder for me?
Babe, I wanna try something
Why the why, why, why?
Why you always get off on the fly
All the shit gets in my way
And makes it harder for me

Babe, I'm busy
You're fucking up what I put work in for
Have you ever met a classic?
She ain't doing it like I did, yea

You realize everything you do
Makes it harder for me
Won't lie, tellin' the truth
You're tryna make it harder for me

Make it harder for me
Why you try to make it harder for me?
Fuck what you see, babe
Fuck it, why you try to make it fuckin' harder for me?
Babe, I wanna try something
Why the why, why, why?
Why you always get off on the fly
All the shit gets in my way
And makes it harder for me

You know I try, try, try
You know why I always be askin'
Always askin'
You better think again-

Make it harder for me
Why you try to make it harder for me?
Fuck what you see, babe
Fuck it, why you try to make it fuckin' harder for me?
Babe, I wanna try something
Why the why, why, why?
Why you always get off on the fly
All the shit gets in my way
And makes it harder for me 2x I love you a lot, never will hate you

Come into my arms
Come into my arms
Come into my arms, babe

I'll kiss you Such a shame to me to fall for the schemes
I was loving the script, but didn't work the scenes
Half way we walked to end up everything
So dumb, I never could see, what it really was
You trying to play with me, and I never realized

You said you were giving up
That it wasn't working well
Thinking bout you every night and day
Used me just to show and tell

Somethings gotta give to be happy
And I know it was only killing me
I was dying slowly with this dance
You pretended everything in this false romance
You did our love turn into a movie
Feels like is missing something in me
Lost you to love me, finally
Everything in this romance, was false baby (yeah)
Now I don't believe in no one more
You hit me like a bullet to the core
Took me time to close this door
Our love is not something anymore (or maybe in here never existed love)
This is the last dance
I learn to take chances
I'm finally breathing, after drowned in this false romance
So dumb, I never could see, what it really was
You trying to play with me, and I never realized

You said you were giving up
That it wasn't working well
Thinking bout you every night and day
Used me just to show and tell

Somethings gotta give to be happy
And I know it was only killing me
I was dying slowly with this dance
You pretended everything in this false romance
You did our love turn into a movie
Feels like is missing something in me
Lost you to love me, finally
Everything in this romance, was false baby (yeah)

Oh romance, I fell so easily for your plans
It is so hard to live knowing that you'll never be back
But never had something between us it was all pretended
Now just last to us to be happy, we false romantics
Oh romance, I fell so easily for your plans
It is so hard to live knowing that you'll never be back
But never had something between us it was all pretended
Now just last to us to be happy, we false romantics
Somethings gotta give, yeah, yuh

Kendji Girac - ""One Last Time (Attends-moi)"" Part I: Knew Better

Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

Cause I see right through you‚ boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more‚ I ain't feelin' you no more)

If you knew better
Boy‚ you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby‚ if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me‚ baby

Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me...
Part II: Forever Boy

Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy (One less, one less problem)

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

I know you're never gonna wake up, I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh, babe)

Talk about what you won't do
Lighten up, cuz you got through
Come on, boo, we're talking 'bout you

Both found guilty behind closed doors
I'll let you see the real me, real me

Oh, Baby
That's...
...
But you get it
That's what I'm for
I'm for Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, my air
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, yeah

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I keep on breathin', oh yeah
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah Real classy how I slip into your mind
And I'm kinda shy, I'm not gemini
You say my love is like the sweetest drug you've tried
I can't switch it up, gotta press the trial

Falling head over heels, you like to feel
One touch and I'll give you chills
Make it then, one kiss and it made me feel
You know the drill, one night and you feel fulfilled
This is the thrill

Can you handle me?
I think you're fuckin' with me (with me)
I know you wanna kiss me (kiss me)
I know you gonna miss me (miss me), miss me
And you're hittin' me, I think you're fuckin' with me
I think you're fuckin' with me
I know you wanna kiss me
I know you gonna miss me, miss me, yeah

....

Falling head over heels, you like to feel
One touch and I'll give you chills
Make it then, one kiss and it made me feel
You know the drill, one night and you feel fulfilled
This is the thrill

Can you handle me?
I think you're fuckin' with me (with me)
I know you wanna kiss me (kiss me)
I know you gonna miss me (miss me), miss me
And you're hittin' me, I think you're fuckin' with me
I think you're fuckin' with me
I know you wanna kiss me
I know you gonna miss me, miss me, yeah

Mhm, yeah
Mhm, yeah You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

You'll believe God is a woman, and I
You'll believe God is a woman

(Yeah)
I tell you all the things you should know
So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

You'll believe God is a woman
You'll believe God is a woman
You'll believe God is a woman, and I

It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
You'll believe God
(God is a woman)
Oh, yeah
(God is a woman, yeah)
(One)
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

And I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can't help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Ariana:
I mean, he was really cute, you know?
He was really cute.
Jennifer:
Yeah.
Ariana:
And it was, it was really big.
Jennifer:
Well, I've only gone out with one guy that had a big front tooth.
And I liked it, 'cause it, he never got anything stuck in the front teeth.
But, have you ever gone out with someone that had no teeth at all?
Ariana:
No. I love you more than anybody else
I know there's someone who wants to meet me so bad
We can let them be our friend
Baby, let's take a walk in the city
I promise I won't mess up on anything
I know plenty of ways to put a smile on your face

Lay with me tonight, lay, lay, lay with me tonight
Don't worry, I will be careful not to itch you with my hair (Babe)
For our own happiness, let's watch our favorite movies
If you have a nightmare, I'll be right there
To soothe you back to sleep

Give me a kiss
I'll relax you by rubbing mango lotion
I'm never gonna bе upset, never gonna be evil
Mwah you, babe
You are allowed to come with me wherever I go
Let's go to the mall and get some treats

Lay with me tonight, lay, lay, lay with me tonight
Don't worry, I will be careful not to itch you with my hair (Babe)
For our own happiness, let's watch our favorite movies
If you have a nightmare, I'll be right there
To soothe you back to sleep

Ooh, take me to one of your favorite places
Maybe I'll like it too
Mango lotion will soothe your nightmares
No matter the condition, we can do anything

Lay with me tonight, lay, lay, lay with me tonight
Don't worry, I will be careful not to itch you with my hair (Babe)
For our own happiness, let's watch our favorite movies
If you have a nightmare, I'll be right there
To soothe you back to sleep Lyrucs are yet not avaible I looked in my rear view mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
'Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Lеt's just go back to the way it was

When we wеre on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light (a yellow light)

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talking about us
And sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
'Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
My baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was? Mmm, yeah

I'm able to feel the love with all this heavenly fruit
I love it like nothing else, mmm
It's the flavor of my perfume, I love it

I got that love feelin' in my head, hmm

Head in the clouds, I got that feelin' about lemons, blueberries, and strawberries
They're so nice, they make me think of the good times we have together
They tell me we'll never ever break apart
I got no problem with you, or the lemons, blueberries, and strawberries, hmm

Having lime wine, Tennessee whiskey
Yeah, baby, it feels like we're on a date in Memphis
Nashville parties, we love 'em so much
There's nothin' else we'd rather do, mmm, baby

Head in the clouds, I got that feelin' about lemons, blueberries, and strawberries
They're so nice, they make me think of the good times we have together
They tell me we'll never ever break apart
I got no problem with you, or the lemons, blueberries, and strawberries, hmm

Hmm, yeah (baby, Tennessee)
Lemons, we love 'em so much (yeah, baby, sing it)

Head in the clouds, I got that feelin' about lemons, blueberries, and strawberries
They're so nice, they make me think of the good times we have together
They tell me we'll never ever break apart
I got no problem with you, or the lemons, blueberries, and strawberries, hmm Lyrics for this song are not available yet still Under these stars and under the moon
Searching for me and I'm looking for you
Show me you're out there
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic (thought that I)
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic (sheesh)
I really thought that I'd be like my grandparents
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic (thought that I) Oh, when i first saw, saw you
I knew it right away, you gonna be my boo
Butterflies flying all around
Every time i hear your name, baby
Butter, butterflies
Butterflies, yeah

Butterflies

Butterflies

Hear your name My hair

         (Verse 1)
Okay I finally understand
You wanted to be the “bigger man”
You couldn't stand not being seen with me
All you wanted was the attention
(Chorus)
But now i’m away From your shit
I found A new bae, and he's cool Wit it
And i just want to say that i'm done with you
So you can go back to being a
No one No body
(Verse 2)
I noticed How you changed after the accident
But i was ɑ Tough woman, and put up with it
It killed me and hurt me and I was in ɑ Terrible state of mind
But you didn’t care all you wanted was me all the time
(Chorus)
But now i'm away From your shit
I found A new bae, and he's cool Wit it
And i just want to say that i'm done with you
So you can go back to being a
No one No body
(Bridge)
I'm finally away, And i'm free from all the toxicity
But that's okay, because they didn't like us anyway
And now they hate you after the things you had to say
But now i’m gone so i can stay away
Ahhhhh
So i can stay away
Ahhhh
So i can stay away Know my love infinite nothing that i won’t do
