"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence."" I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmmmm

When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Asking only workman's wages, I come lookin' for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, lalalalalalala

Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me
Leadin' me
Goin' home

In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
I love you Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo, wo, wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo, wo, wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids

Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo, wo, wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at it, you lose

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Woo, woo, woo
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
On the side of a hill, in the deep forest green
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground
Without no seams nor needle work
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

Tell her to find me an acre of land
On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the salt water and the sea strands
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Generals order their soldiers to kill
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind ""Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together""
""I've got some real estate here in my bag""
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies
And walked off to look for America

""Kathy,"" I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
""Michigan seems like a dream to me now""
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said ""Be careful his bowtie is really a camera""

""Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat""
""We smoked the last one an hour ago""
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

""Kathy, I'm lost,"" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would

I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would

Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world
Its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would A winter’s day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow

I am a rock
I am an island

I’ve built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It’s laughter and it’s loving I disdain

I am a rock
I am an island

Don’t talk of love
Well, I’ve heard the word before
It’s sleeping in my memory
I won’t disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried

I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears

They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
(Ba ba ba ba)
Scoot down the road
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
Shine the light

My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mama's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve

They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
(Ba ba ba ba)
Scoot down the road
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel

My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
There's no-one home, we're all alone
Oh, come into my room and play
Yes, we can play

I'm not talking about your pigtails
But I'm talking 'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
(Ba ba ba ba)
Scoot down the road
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel 'Cilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
'Cilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someone's taken my place

'Cilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Take it up, take it up)
(Take it up, take it up)

Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and die laughing
Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and die laughing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh April, come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
May, she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June, she’ll change her tune
In restless walks, she’ll prowl the night
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight
August, die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September, I’ll remember
A love once new has now grown old Tom, get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am
The only living boy in New York

I get the news I need on the weather report
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da and here I am
The only living boy in New York

Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where
And we don't know where
Here I am...
Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where
And we don't know where

Tom, get your plane right on time
I know that you've been eager to fly now
Hey, let your honesty shine, shine, shine now
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da
Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York

Here I am...
Here I am... I'm sittin' in the railway station
Got a ticket for my destination, mmm
On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Everyday's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines, Mmm
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend, mmm
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Silently for me I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England, where my heart lies

My mind’s distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you’re asleep
And kiss you when you start your day

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don’t know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can’t believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see, I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain

I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside's,
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground...
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground...
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground... I can hear the soft breathing
Of the girl that I love
As she lies here beside me
Asleep with the night
And her hair, in a fine mist
Floats on my pillow
Reflecting the glow
Of the winter moonlight

She is soft, she is warm
But my heart remains heavy
And I watch as her breasts
Gently rise, gently fall
For I know with the first light of dawn
I'll be leaving
And tonight will be
All I have left to recall

Oh, what have I done?
Why have I done it?
I've committed a crime
Broken the law
For twenty-five dollars
And pieces of silver
I held up and robbed
A hard liquor store

My life seems unreal
My crime an illusion
A scene badly written
In which I must play
Yet I know as I gaze
At my young love beside me
The morning is just a few hours away Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da ... feelin' groovy

Hello, lamppost, whatcha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo, feelin' groovy
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da ... feelin' groovy

I've got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovy Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game
Send out for whiskey, baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin
When I ain't drinking, baby
You are on my mind
When I ain't sleeping, honey
When I ain't sleeping, Mama
When I ain't sleeping
Well, you know you find me cryin'
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game
Living is a gamble, baby
Loving's much the same
Wherever I have played
Wherever I throw those dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game
Maybe when I'm older, baby
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, Mama
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin'
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same Fog's rollin' in off the East River bank
Like a shroud it covers Bleecker Street
Fills the alleys where men sleep
Hides the shepherd from the sheep
Voices leaking from a sad cafe
Smiling faces try to understand
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
On Bleecker Street
A poet reads his crooked rhyme
Holy, holy is his sacrament
Thirty dollars pays your rent
On Bleecker Street
I heard a church bell softly chime
In a melody sustaining
It's a long road to Canaan
On Bleecker Street
Bleecker Street Old friends
Old friends
Sat on their park bench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes
Of the old friends

Old friends
Winter companions
The old men
Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city
Sifting through trees
Settle like dust
On the shoulders
Of the old friends

Can you imagine us
Years from today
Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange
To be seventy

Old friends
Memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fears Time it was
And what a time it was
It was...
A time of innocence
A time of confidences
Long ago, it must be
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you Someone told me
It's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true

It's a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park;
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take the crosstown bus
If it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it
If you do
If you do now

Something tells me
It's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true

The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum
Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas! You gotta come and see
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo It's a still life water color
Of a now late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time
And the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow
I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives I been Norman Mailered, Maxwell Taylored
I been John O'Hara'd, McNamara'd
I been Rolling Stoned and Beatled 'til I'm blind
I been Ayn Randed, nearly branded
Communist, cause I'm left-handed
That's the hand I use...well, never mind

I been Phil Spectored, resurrected
I been Lou Adlered, Barry Sadlered
Well, I paid all the dues I want to pay
And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce
And all of my wealth won't buy me health
So I smoke a pint of tea a day

I knew a man, his brain so small
He couldn't think of nothing at all
Not the same as you and me
He doesn't dig poetry
He's so unhip when you say Dylan
He thinks you're talking about Dylan Thomas
Whoever he was
The man ain't got no culture
But it's alright, Ma
Everybody must get stoned

I been Mick Jaggered, been silver daggered
Andy Warhol, won't you please come home?
I been mothered, fathered, aunt and uncled
Been Roy Haleed and Art Garfunkeled
I just discovered somebody's tapped my phone

(Folk rock...)
(I've lost my harmonica, Albert...) Time it was
And what a time it was
It was a time of innocence
A time of confidences
Long ago, it must be
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you Gee, but it’s great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I’ve been on the road so long, my friend
And if you came along
I know you couldn’t disagree

It’s the same old story, yeah
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I’m one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

Deputy Sheriff said to me
“Tell me what you come here for, boy
You better get your bags and flee
You’re in trouble, boy
And now you’re heading into more”

It’s the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I’m one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

And it’s the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I’m so tired
I’m oh, so tired
But I’m trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
The room was filled with men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the papers all were signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing round and round
And guns and swords and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war They say that Richard Cory owns
One-half of this whole town
With political connections
To spread his wealth around
Born into society
A banker’s only child
He had everything a man could want
Power, grace and style

But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I’m living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Richard Cory

The papers print his picture
Almost everywhere he goes
Richard Cory at the opera
Richard Cory at a show
And the rumor of his party
And the orgies on his yacht!
Oh he surely must be happy
With everything he’s got

But I...
I work in his factory
And I curse the life I’m living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Richard Cory

He freely gave to charity
He had the common touch
And they were grateful for his patronage
And they thanked him very much
So my mind was filled with wonder
When the evening headlines read
“Richard Cory went home last night
And put a bullet through his head”

But I...
I work in his factory
And I curse the life I’m living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Richard Cory Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, J'ai de la misère oh
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, J'ai de la misère oh
Pitie moi malade, Je cours à la maison du gangan Similo
Pitie moi malade, Je cours à la maison du gangan , si gangan est bon
Il me sauvera la vie , J'ai de la misère oh
Actual Haitian Creole lyrics:
Fèy, o! Sove lavi mwen. Nan mizè mwen ye, o!
Fèy, o! Sove lavi mwen. Nan mizè mwen ye, o!
Pitit mwen malad, mwen kouri kay gangan Similo
Pitit mwen malad, mwen kouri kay gangan. Si li bon gangan
Sove lavi mwen, nan mizè mwen ye, o!
English translation:
Oh leaves, save my life. I'm in misery. Oh!
Oh leaves, save my life. I'm in misery. Oh!
Little me is sick. I run to the house of Similo (the spiritual healer)
Little me is sick. I run to the house of the spiritual healer. If he's a good one
He'll save my life. I'm in misery. Oh! Who will love a little Sparrow?
Who's traveled far and cries for rest?
""Not I,"" said the Oak Tree
""I won't share my branches with no sparrow's nest
And my blanket of leaves won't warm her cold breast.""
Who will love a little Sparrow
And who will speak a kindly word?
""Not I,"" said the Swan
""The entire idea is utterly absurd
I'd be laughed at and scorned if the other Swans heard.""
And who will take pity in his heart
And who will feed a starving sparrow?
""Not I,"" said the Golden Wheat
""I would if I could but I cannot, I know
I need all my grain to prosper and grow.""
Who will love a little Sparrow?
Will no one write her eulogy?
""I will,"" said the Earth
""For all I've created returns unto me
From dust were ye made and dust ye shall be."" So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
I can't believe your song is gone so soon
I barely learned the tune
So soon
So soon

I'll remember Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long

Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view
When I run dry
I stop awhile and think of you
Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view

So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
(""So long already, Artie!"")
So long
So long Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace

This is the early evening edition of the news. The recent fight in the House of Representatives was over the open housing
Section of the Civil Rights Bill brought traditional enemies together but it left the defenders of the measure without the votes of their strongest supporters. President Johnson originally proposed an outright ban covering discrimination by everyone for every type of housing but it had no chance from the start, and everyone in Congress knew it. A compromise was painfully worked out in the House Judiciary Committee
In Los Angeles today comedian Lenny Bruce died of what was believed to be an overdose of narcotics. Bruce was 42 years old
Dr. Martin Luther King says he does not intend to cancel plans for an open housing march Sunday into the Chicago suburb of Cicero. Cook County Sheriff Richard Ogleby asked King to call off the march and the police in Cicero said they would ask the National Guard to be called out if it is held. King, now in Atlanta, Georgia, plans to return to Chicago Tuesday
In Chicago Richard Speck, accused murderer of nine student nurses, was brought before a grand jury today for indictment. The nurses were found stabbed an strangled in their Chicago apartment
In Washington the atmosphere was tense today as a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities continued its probe into anti-Vietnam war protests. Demonstrators were forcibly evicted from the hearings when they began chanting anti-war slogans. Former Vice-President Richard Nixon says that unless there is a substantial increase in the present war effort in Viet nam, the U.S. should look forward to five more years of war. In a speech before the Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New York Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single weapon working against the U.S
That's the 7 o'clock edition of the news. Goodnight When she goes, she's gone
If she stays, she stays here
The girl does what she wants to do
She knows what she wants to do
And I know I'm fakin' it
I'm not really makin' it

I'm such a dubious soul
And a walk in the garden
Wears me down
Tangled in the fallen vines
Picking up the punch lines
I've just been fakin' it
Not really makin' it

Is there any danger?
No, no, not really
Just lean on me
Taking time to treat
Your friendly neighbors honestly
I've just been fakin' it, fakin' it
Not really makin' it
This feeling of fakin' it--
I still haven't shaken it

Prior to this lifetime
I surely was a tailor, look at me...
(""Good morning, Mr. Leitch
Have you had a busy day?"")
I own the tailor's face and hands
I am the tailor's face and hands
I know I'm fakin' it, fakin' it
I'm not really makin' it
This feeling of fakin' it--
I still haven't shaken it, shaken it
I know I'm fakin' it
I'm not really makin' it The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within it's silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem comprised
Of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night He was my brother
Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twenty-three years old the day he died

Freedom rider
They cursed my brother to his face
Go home, outsider
This town's gonna be your buryin' place

He was singin' on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong

He was my brother
Tears can't bring him back to me
He, he was my brother
And he died so his brothers could be free
He died so his brothers could be free Through the corridors of sleep
Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I don't know what is real
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection
I'm blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

No matter if you're born
To play the king or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall Benedictus qui venit
In nomine Domini
In nomine
In nomine
In nomine Domini
In nomine Domini
In nomine
In nomine
In nomine Domini The sun is burning in the sky
Strands of clouds go slowly drifting by
In the park the lazy bees
Are joining in the flowers, among the trees
And the sun burns in the sky

Now the sun is in the West
Little kids go home to take their rest
And the couples in the park
Are holdin' hands and waitin' for the dark
And the sun is in the West

Now the sun is sinking low
Children playin' know it's time to go
High above a spot appears
A little blossom blooms and then draws near
And the sun is sinking low

Now the sun has come to Earth
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death
Death comes in a blinding flash
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash
And the sun has come to Earth

Now the sun has disappeared
All is darkness, anger, pain and fear
Twisted, sightless wrecks of men
Go groping on their knees and cry in pain
And the sun has disappeared Wish I was a Kellogg's Cornflake
Floatin' in my bowl takin' movies
Relaxin' awhile, livin' in style
Talkin' to a raisin who 'casion'ly plays L.A.,
Casually glancing at his toupee

Wish I was an English muffin
'Bout to make the most out of a toaster
I'd ease myself down
Comin' up brown
I prefer boysenberry more than any ordinary jam
I'm a ""Citizens for Boysenberry Jam"" fan

Ah, South California

If I become a first lieutenant
Would you put my photo on your piano?
""To Maryjane--
Best wishes, Martin""
Old Roger draft-dodger
Leavin' by the basement door
Everybody knows what he's
Tippy-toeing down there for

Oh, really? Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Down in the lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watch
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shown a holy light

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Down in the lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Jesus Christ is born Why don't we stop fooling ourselves?
The game is over, over, over
No good times, no bad times
There's no times at all
Just The New York Times
Sitting on the windowsill
Near the flowers

We might as well be apart
It hardly matters
We sleep separately
And drop a smile passing in the hall
But there's no laughs left
'Cause we laughed them all
And we laughed them all
In a very short time

Time
Is tapping on my forehead
Hanging from my mirror
Rattling the teacups
And I wonder

How long can I delay?
We're just a habit
Like saccharin
And I'm habitually feelin' kinda blue
But each time I try on the thought of leaving you
I stop...
Stop and think it over In my little town
I grew up believing
God keeps His eye on us all
And He used to lean upon me
As I pledged allegiance to the wall
Lord I recall
My little town

Coming home after school
Flying my bike past the gates
Of the factories
My mom doing the laundry
Hanging our shirts
In the dirty breeze

And after it rains
There's a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there
It's just imagination they lack
Everything's the same

Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town

I never meant nothing
I was Just my father's son
Saving my money
Dreaming of glory
Twitching like a finger
On the trigger of a gun
Leaving nothing but the dead and dying

Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song
I’m twenty-two now but I won’t be for long
Time hurries on

And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

Once my heart was filled with love of a girl
I held her close but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write

And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound

And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
That’s all there is

And the leaves that are green turn to brown Bye bye, love
Bye bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love
Bye bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, goodbye

There goes my baby
With someone new
She sure looks happy
I sure am blue
She was my baby
Till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance
That might have been

Bye bye, love
Bye bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love
Bye bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, goodbye

I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I'm through with counting
The stars above
And here's the reason
That I'm so free
My loving baby
Is through with me

Bye bye, love
Bye bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love
Bye bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, goodbye
Bye bye, my love, goodbye
Bye bye, my love, goodbye
Bye bye, my love, goodbye Man 1: I got little in this world. I give honesty without regret. One hundred dollars for that picture. I remember taking a picture with...
Woman 1: Ooh! Let me show you. Let me show you our picture. This was me and my husband when we were first married
Woman 2: I always slept on one side, left room for my husband
Woman 1: And that's me when we were sixteen
Woman 2: But this, this, this, this is not the case. I still do it. I still lay on the half of the bed. (pause) We used to sneak in...
Man 2: Still haven't seen the doctor I was seein'; there's been blood for the last, eh, forty-eight hours, and I can't get up the mucus for the last, eh, two, three months... oh yes, and I maintain, I maintain strongly, to this minute, I don't think it's an ordinary cold
Woman 3: God forgive me, but an old person without money is pathetic
Woman 4: Children, and mothers, that's the way we have it. A mother-- they are 
Woman 5: Cause mothers do too much
Woman 4: That is mother's life, to live for your child. (pause) Yes, my dear
Man 3: I couldn't get younger. I have to be an old man. That's all. Well...
Woman 6: Are you happy here, honey? Are you happy living with us?
Man 3: So anytime I walk with Lou and... that's all
Woman 6: Mr. Singer? Are you happy living with us here?
Woman 7: But we don't do that, dear
Woman 6: But are you happy?
Woman 7: If you mean, if, if you could say, yes, and I thought, and I was so happy, and everybody, ""What is this? What is it?""
Woman 8: It just is, beautiful. Like, just a room. Your own room, in your own home ""He was a most peculiar man""
That’s what Mrs. Riordan says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone
Within a house
Within a room
Within himself
A most peculiar man

He had no friends
He seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
‘Cause he wasn’t friendly and he didn’t care
And he wasn’t like them
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man

He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas
And he went to sleep
With the windows closed
So he’d never wake up
To his silent world
And his tiny room
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon

And all the people said
“What a shame that he’s dead
But wasn’t he a most peculiar man?” Well, you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
Into my heart

Well, my Lord spoke, he spoke so well
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Talked about the flames that burn in hell
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Now, my Lord spoke, he spoke so well
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Talked about the children of Israel
Yes, he did, yes, he did
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart

Well, you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
Into my heart

Well, my Lord spoke, he spoke to me
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Talkin' about a man from Galilee
Yes, he did, yes, he did
My Lord spoke, he spoke to me
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Talkin' about a man from Galilee
Yes, he did, yes, he did
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart

Well, you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
Into my heart

Well, I don't know but I've been told
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Streets of heaven are paved with gold
Yes, he did, yes, he did
Now, the Jordan River is chilly and wide
Yes, he did, yes, he did
I got a home on the other side
Yes, he did, yes, he did
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart

Well, you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
Into my heart ""Good God! Don't jump!""
A boy sat on the ledge
An old man who had fainted was revived (he's alright)
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed
If the boy survived

""Save the life of my child!""
Cried the desperate mother

The woman from the supermarket
Ran to call the cops
""He must be high on something,"" someone said
Though it never made The New York Times
In The Daily News, the caption read

""""Save the life of my child!""
Cried the desperate mother""

Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again

A patrol car passing by
Halted to a stop
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:
""The force can't do a decent job
Cause the kids got no respect
For the law today (and blah blah blah).""

""Save the life of my child!""
Cried the desperate mother
""Oh, what's becoming of the children?""
People asking each other

When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd
And it made them wild
In the atmosphere of freaky holiday
When the spotlight hit the boy
And the crowd began to cheer
He flew away

""Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place."" Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows
Blessed are the sat upon, spat upon, ratted on
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?
I got no place to go
I’ve walked around Soho for the last night or so
Ah, but it doesn’t matter, no
Blessed is the land and the kingdom
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to
Blessed are the meth drinkers, pot sellers, illusion dwellers
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?
My words trickle down
From a wound that I have no intention to heal
Blessed are the stained glass, windowpane glass
Blessed is the church service, makes me nervous
Blessed are the penny rookers, cheap hookers, groovy lookers
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?
I...
I have tended my own garden much too long Cloudy
The sky is gray and white and cloudy
Sometimes I think it's hanging down on me
And it's a hitchhike a hundred miles
I'm a ragamuffin child
Pointed finger painted smile
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while

Cloudy
My thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy
They have no borders, no boundaries
They echo and they swell
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell
Down from Berkeley to Carmel
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill

Hey, sunshine
I haven't seen you in a long time
Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?
These clouds stick to the sky
Like a floating question, why?
And they linger there to die
They don't know where they are going, and, my friend, neither do I

Cloudy
Cloudy Here is my song for the asking
Ask me and I will play
So sweetly, I'll make you smile
This is my tune for the taking
Take it, don't turn away
I've been waiting all my life

Thinking it over, I've been sad
Thinking it over, I'd be more than glad
To change my ways for the asking
Ask me and I will play
All the love that I hold inside I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love
As she lies here beside me asleep with the night
Her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight
But I’ve got to creep down the alleyway
Fly down the highway
Before they come to catch me I’ll be gone
Somewhere they can’t find me
Oh, baby, you don’t know what I’ve done
I’ve committed a crime, I’ve broken the law
While you were here sleeping and just dreaming of me
I held up and robbed a liquor store
But I’ve got to creep down the alleyway
Fly down the highway
Before they come to catch me I’ll be gone
Somewhere they can’t find me
Oh, my life seems unreal, my crime an illusion
A scene badly written in which I must play
And though it puts me up tight to leave you
I know it’s not right to leave you
When morning is just a few hours away
But I’ve got to creep down the alleyway
Fly down the highway
Before they come to catch me I’ll be gone
Somewhere they can’t find me New York
To that tall skyline I come
Flyin' in from London
To your door
New York
Lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark
New York
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
There's a heart
A heart that lives in New York
A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, the love in her eyes
An open door and a friend for the night
New York
You've got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's worth of difference
So here's to you New York The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should
For in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin
Or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns
That can scarcely be controlled Why don't you write me
I'm out in the jungle
I'm hungry to hear you
Send me a card
I am waiting so hard
To be near you
(La, la, la)
Why don't you write?

Something is wrong
And I know I got to be there
Maybe I'm lost
But I can't make the cost
Of the airfare
Tell me why
Why
Why
Tell me why
Why
Why

Why don't you write me
A letter would brighten
My loneliest evening
Mail it today
If it's only to say
That you're leaving me
(La, la, la)

Monday morning, sitting in the sun
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come
Tuesday, never got a word
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign
Drank a half a bottle of iodine
Friday, woe is me
I'm gonna hang my body from the highest tree
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me? Do people have a tendency to dump on you?
Does your group have more cavities than theirs?
Do all the hippies seem to get the jump on you?
Do you sleep alone when other sleep in pairs?
Well there's no need to complain
We'll eliminate your pain
We can neutralize your brain

You'll feel just fine
Now
Buy a big bright green pleasure machine!

Do figures of authority just shoot you down?
Is life within the business world a drag?

To find yourself a more productive bag?
Are you worried and distressed?
Can't seem to get no rest?
Put our product to the test

You'll feel just fine
Now
Buy a big bright green pleasure machine!

You better hurry up and order one
Our limited supply is very nearly gone

Are you looking for a way to chuck it all?
We can end your daily strife
At a reasonable price
You've seen it advertised in Life

You'll feel just fine
Now
Buy a big bright green pleasure machine When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks better in black and white
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville
A Cadillac rollin' on the open road
But nothing will outrace my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
Bumper to bumper and side by side
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
The heat cooled down, the motor cooled down
That's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead
Hundred and ten half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's standin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do   As we marched down to Fennario
As we marched down to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And they called her name pretty Peggy-O

Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come a runnin' down the stairs
Combin' back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest little girl I have ever seen-o

In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-O
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-O
In a carriage you will ride
With your true love by your side
As fair as any maiden in the area-o

What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mother say
When she finds you've gone away
To places far and strange to Fennario?

If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return
All your cities I will burn
Destroying all the ladies in the area-o
Destroying all the ladies in the area-o Slow down, you move too fast
You've got to make the morning last
Just kickin' down the cobble stones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da-da da da, feelin' groovy
Hello lamppost, what'cha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
Do-in do do, feelin' groovy
Ba da-da-da da da, feelin' groovy
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning-time drop all its petals on me
Life I love you, all is groovy
Ba da da da da da da da
Ba da da da da da da da
Ba da da da da da da da Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone

For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics
Who prophesise with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win

For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, Congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he that has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls

For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers
All over the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand

For the times they are a-changin'

The line, it is drawn
The curse, it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
And the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
The first one now
Will later be last

For the times they are a-changin'
For the times they are a-changin' God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we we're gone astray
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we we're gone astray
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy Bad news, bad news

We’ve got a groovy thing.... The mama pajama rolled outta bed and she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout, and they started the investigation
And it's against the law, it was against the law
What the mama saw, it was against the law
The mama looked down and spit on the ground ev'ry time my name gets mentioned
The papa said ""oy, if I ever get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of Detention""
Well, I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm on my way, I'm takin' my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
See you, Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard
See you, Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard
In a couple of days they come and take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest comes to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm on my way, I'm takin' my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye Rosie, the queen of Corona
See you, Me And Julio Down By the Schoolyard
See you, Me And Julio Down By the Schoolyard
See you, Me And Julio Down By the Schoolyard Many's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
And I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
But it's all right, it's all right
I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be
Bright and Bon Vivant
So far away from home
So far away from home
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
Don't have a friend who feels at ease
Don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to its knees
But it's all right, all right
We've lived so well so long
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it
I wonder what went wrong
And I dreamed I was flying
I dreamed my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down on me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was dying
And far above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty
Drifting away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying
We come on a ship we call the Mayflower
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come at the age's most uncertain hour
And sing the American tune
But it's all right, its all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest
That's all, I'm trying to get some rest Is it a kind of dream
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream?
Oh, is it a dream?

There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes
Burning like fire
Bright eyes
How can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes

Is it a kind of shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh, into the dark
 
Bright eyes
Burning like fire
Bright eyes
How can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes ""The problem is all inside your head,"" she said to me
""The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover.""
She said, ""It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover.""
50 ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
She said, ""It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again.""
I said, ""I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""
She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
50 ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus

You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
Whoah and I know a man, he came from my hometown
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said dolores, I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering, I'm afraid that I will disappear
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
I know a woman, (who) became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day is when I lie in the bed
And I think of things that might have been
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
And I know a father who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
He came a long way just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and he headed home again
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
Whoah God only knows, God makes his plan
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway, when in fact we're slip sliding away
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
In darkened roads
When pain is all you find
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Sail on silver girl
Sail on high
Your time has come to shine
Put your faith on me
And let it shine
I'll see the sun
Upon your bedroom light
Like a bridge over troubled water
Let it be your guide
Like a bridge over troubled water
Let it be your guide You don't know that you love me
You don't know but I know that you do
You may think you're above me, yeah
What you think isn't always true
Don't try to debate me
You should know that I'm womanly wise
Still you try to manipulate me
You don't know where your interest lies
No, you don't know where your interest lies
You don't begin to comprehend
You're just a game I like to play
You may think that we're friends all right
But I won't let friendship get in my way
No, I won't let friendship get in my way
Indications indicate running the same riff will turn you around
Obviously you're going to blow it
But you don't know it
You don't know that you love me
You don't know but I know that you do
You may think that you're above me, yeah
What you think isn't always true
Don't try to debate me
You should know that I'm womanly wise
Still you try to manipulate me

No, you don't know where your interest Old friends
Old friends
Sat on their park bench
Like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes
Of the old friends
Old friends
Winter companions
The old men
Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city
Sifting through trees
Settles like dust
On the shoulders
Of the old friends
Can you imagine us
Years from today
Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange
To be seventy
Old friends
Memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fear
Time it was
And what a time it was
It was ...
A time of innocence
A time of confidences
Long ago ... it must be ...
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you The first thing I remember I was lying in my bed
It couldn't have been no more than one or two
I remember there's a radio
Comin' from the room next door
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through
The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue
Some guys were shootin' pool
And I heard the sound
Of a-cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah
Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J""
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away
The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I've been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way I loved you
It was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
We've both been sound asleep, wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
Whatta we gonna tell your mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say ""ooh-la-la""
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
I told your mama that you'd be in by ten
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
We gotta go home
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
Whatta we gonna tell your mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say ""ooh-la-la""
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie I been Norman Mailer'd, Maxwell Taylor'd
I been John O'Hara'd, McNamara'd
I been Rolling Stoned and Beatled till I'm blind
I been Ayn Rand'd, nearly branded
Communist, 'cause I'm left-handed
That's the hand I use, well, never mind!
I been Phil Spector'd, resurrected
I been Lou Adler'd, Barry Sadler'd
Well, I paid all the dues I want to pay
And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce
And all my wealth won't buy me health
So I smoke a pint of tea a day
I knew a man, his brain was so small
He couldn't think of nothing at all
He's not the same as you and me
He doesn't dig poetry. He's so unhip that
When you say ""Dylan"", he thinks you're talking about Dylan Thomas
Whoever he was
The man ain't got no culture
But it's all right, ma
Everybody must get stoned
I been Mick Jagger'd, silver daggered
Andy Warhol, won't you please come home?
I been mothered, fathered, aunt and uncled
Been Roy Halee'd and Art Garfunkel'd
I just discovered somebody's tapped my phone When I think back on all the crap I've learned in highschool
It's a wonder I can think at all
Though my lack of education hasn't hurt me much
I can read the writings on the walls

Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
Brought 'em all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks better in black and white

Mama don't take my Kodachrome away, mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome, mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome and leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome, whew whew, mama don't take my Kodachrome away I met my old lover
On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years
I'm not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years
Four in the morning
Crapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I?
It's all gonna fade
Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years I am a citizen of the planet
I was born here
I'm going to die here
Come what may
I am entitled by my birth
To the treasures of the earth
No one must be denied these
No one must be denied
Easy dreams
At the end of a chain-smokin' day
Easy dreams at the end of the day
Who am I to believe
That the future we perceive
Lies in danger and the dangers increase
Who are we to demand
That the leaders of the land
Hear the voices of reason and peace
We are the citizens of the planet
We were born here
We're going to die here
Come what may
We are entitled by our birth
To the treasures of the earth
No one must be denied these
No one must be denied
Easy dreams at the end of a chain-smokin' day
Easy dreams at the end of the day
Who am I to deny
What my eyes can clearly see
And raise a child with a flame in his heart
Who are we to believe
That these thoughts are so na've
When we've all disagreed from the start
We are the citizens of the planet
We were born here
We're gong to die here
Come what may
We are entitled by our birth
To the treasures of the earth
No one must be denied these
No one must be denied
Easy dreams at the end of a chain-smokin' day
Easy dreams at the end of the day Simon And Garfunkel
Wednesday Morning, 3 AM
The Times Are A-changin'
Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
'Cause the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorways
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he that has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers
All over the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
And the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
The first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'
For the times they are a-changin' Long years ago, on a deep winter night
High in the heavens, a star shone bright
While in the manger, a wee baby lay
Sweetly asleep, on a bed of hay
Jesus our lord, was that baby so small
Lay down to sleep, in a humble stall
Then came the star, and it stood over head
Shedding its light, 'round his little head
Dear baby Jesus, how tiny thou art
I'll make a place, for thee in my heart
And when the stars, in the heavens I see
Ever and always, I'd think of thee... Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si me l'eau
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si lu bon gang-gang
Sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si me l'eau
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si lu bon gang-gang
Sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Dans mes yeux mouilles oh
English translation:
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, like the water
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, if you read me, good doctor
Save my life, in my wet eyes
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, like the water
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, if you read me, good doctor
Save my life, in my wet eyes
In my wet eyes Old friends

Sat on their park bench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes

Like a shroud, it covers Bleecker Street
Fills the alleys where men sleep
Hides the shepherd from the sheep
Voices leaking from a sad café
Smiling faces try to understand
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
On Bleecker Street
A poet reads his crooked rhyme
Holy, holy is his sacrament
Thirty dollars pays your rent
On Bleecker Street
I heard a church bell softly chime
In a melody sustainin'
It's a long road to Canaan
On Bleecker Street
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

(Art:)
Paul and I go back to the sixth grade when we grew up in Queens. They cast the two of us in the elementary school graduation play Alice in Wonderland. I was the Cheshire Cat, and it's been a lot of laughs ever since. With a few interruptions this would be the fiftieth anniversary of this friendship that I deeply cherish
(Paul:)
We met when we were eleven years old in Alice in Wonderland and I was the White Rabbit – it’s a leading role – and Artie was the Cheshire Cat – it was a supporting role, a very important, very important supporting role. Now, we started to sing together when we were thirteen years old, and we started to argue when we were fourteen years old. So that makes this the forty-seventh anniversary of our arguing
(Art:)
Now we only argued about one thing if you want to know the truth, from the very beginning, there was only one thing that was the basis of everything else: when we first formed our group I wanted to call us Garfunkel and Simon
(Paul:)
You should do that. Now we don’t argue any more. Now we say, ...now we say: that’s your opinion and I respect that. We made our first record when we were sixteen years old. They called us Tom & Jerry, and our song was called ""Hey School Girl in the Second Row"", and it went like this... He was my brother
Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twenty-three years old the day he died
Freedom rider
They cursed my brother to his face
Go home, outsider
This town's gonna be your buryin' place
He was singin' on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong
He was my brother
Tears can't bring him back to me
He, he was my brother
And he died so his brothers could be free
He died so his brothers could be free 'Twas in the merry month of May
When green bugs were a-swellin'
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For the love of Barbriallen
He sent his servant to the town
The place where she'd been dwellin'
Sayin', ""Master dear has sent me here
If your name be Barbriallen""
And slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man I think you are dyin'""
Oh, don't you remember the other day
When we where in a tavern?
You drank your health to the ladies there
And you slided Barbriallen
He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
Adieu, adieu to all my friends
Be kind to Barbriallen
She looked to the east, she looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh, put him down for me"", she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""
The more she looked, the more she grieved
She bursted it out in cryin'
Oh, pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dyin'
They buried sweet Willy in the old church yard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willy's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green brier
They grew and they grew on the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they tied in a true love's knot
The rose bush and the brier I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
If I could, I surely would
Hmm mmm
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
If I only could, I surely would
Hmm mmm
Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world its saddest sound, its saddest sound
Hmm mmm
I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would
If I could, I surely would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
If I only could, I surely would Hey schoolgirl in the second row
The teacher's lookin' over
So I got to whisper way down low
To say who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop
Let's meet after school at three
She said, ""Hey babe
But there is one thing more
My school is over at half past four
Maybe whe we're older, then we can date
O-oh, let's wait""
Hey schoolgirl in the second row
The teacher's lookin' over
So I got to whisper way down low
To say who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop
Let's meet after school at three
She said, ""Hey babe, I got a lot to do
It takes me hours
'Til my homework's through
Someday we'll go steady
So don't you fret
O-oh, not yet""
Hey schoolgirl in the second row
The teacher's lookin' over
So I got to whisper way down low
To say who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop
Let's meet after school at three
Then she turned around to me
With that gleam in her eye
She said, ""I'm sorry if I passed you by
I'm gonna skip my homework
Gonna cut my class
Bug out of here real fast""
Hey schoolgirl in the second row
Now we're going steady
Hear the words that I want you to know
Well it's who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop
You're mine, I knew it all the time A church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying
They grow in the sky
Like hands that are praying
The fire ascends
You can burn down my churches
But I shall be free
Three hooded men through the back roads did creep
Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep
Down to the church where, just hours before
Voices were singing, and
Hands were meeting, and
Saying, ""I won't be a slave anymore""
A church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying
They glow in the sky
Like hands that are praying
The fire ascends
You can burn down my churches
But I shall be free
Three hooded men, their hands lit the spark
And they faded in the night, they vanished in the dark
And in the cold light of morning, there was nothing that remained
But the ashes of a Bible and a can of kerosene
A church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying
They glow in the sky
Like hands that are prayin'
The fire ascends
You can burn down my churches
But I shall be free
A church is more than just timber and stone
And freedom is a dark road when you're walking it alone
But the future is now, and it's time to take a stand
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land
A church is burning
The flames rise higher
Like hands that are praying
They glow in the sky
Like hands that are praying
The fire ascends
You can burn down my churches
But I shall be free I should have known you'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not
The only starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me
And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball
You never cared for secrets I'd confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running, never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball
The story's in the past with nothing to recall
I've got my life to live and I
Don't need you at all
The roller coaster ride we took is
Nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend
And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball Instrumental The sun is burning in the sky
Strands of clouds go slowly drifting by
In the park the lazy bees
Are droning in the flowers, among the trees
And the sun burns in the sky
Now the sun is in the west
Little kids go home to take their rest
And the couples in the park
Are holdin' hands and waitin' for the dark
And the sun is in the west
Now the sun is sinking low
Children playin' know it's time to go
High above a spot appears
A little blossom blooms and then draws near
And the sun is sinking low
Now the sun has come to Earth
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death
Death comes in a blinding flash
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash
And the sun has come to Earth
Now the sun has disappeared
All is darkness, anger, pain, and fear
Twisted, sightless wrecks of men
Go groping on their knees and cry in pain
And the sun has disappeared In a vine-covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows
Tis that silver-haired daddy of mine
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver-haired daddy of mine
Oh, I know it's too late, dear old Daddy
To repay all those sorrows and cares
Though dear Mother is waiting in heaven
Just to comfort and solace you there
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver-haired daddy of mine
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver-haired daddy of mine Saturday night and I'm all alone
Don't have a date, I'm just sittin' home
The radio's playin' the tap tunes tonight
Play me a sad song (oh yes)
Please mister deejay (yes)
Play me a sad song tonight (ooh-ooh)
Don't you think I wanna go where other kids go
Don't you know I wanna do what other kids do
I've got nobody to hold me tight (ooh yes)
Play me a sad song (oh yes)
Please mister deejay (yes)
Play me a sad song tonight
Don't wanna hear a lullaby
I can't sleep, I just sit and cry
Play me a sad song, a song of love
'Cause that's all that I'm thinking of
Sittin' here cryin' won't get me the girl
I bet I'm the loneliest boy in the world
Oh what's the use, guess I'll turn off the light (ooh yes)
Play me a sad song (oh yes)
Please mister deejay (yes)
Play me a sad song (oh yes)
I feel so lonely (yes)
Please mister deejay (oh yes)
Play me a sad song (yes) ""The problem is all inside your head,"" she said to me
""The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover""
She said, ""It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover""
50 ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Ooh, just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
She said, ""It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again""
I said, ""I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?""
She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
50 ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free I'm a rambler I'm a gambler
I'm a long way from my home
If you people don't like me
I can make out on my own
'Casue it's dark
And it's rainin'
And the Moon gives no light
And my pony can hardly travel
On this darkened road at night
You know once I had a true love
Though her age was just sixteen
She was the flower of Belton
And the rose of Aberdeen
But her parents did not like me
And now she feels much the same
If I'm writ on in your Diary
Well blot out my name
'Cause there's changes in the ocean
And there's changes in the sea
And there's changes in my own true love
But there ain't to changin' me (Spoken by Paul Simon)
Listen closely to this thing, because-
(Spoken by an engineer)
Okay, Paul!
(Spoken by Paul Simon)
-where I wanna go with on the arrangements
(Spoken by an engineer)
You're going

The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within it's silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem comprised
Of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness
And be suckled by the night, ooh I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler
I'm a long way from my home
If you people don't like me
I can make out on my own
'Cause it's dark, and it's rainin'
And the moon gives no light
And my pony can hardly travel
On this darkened road at night
You know once I had a true love
Lord, her age was just sixteen
She was the flower of Belton
And the rose of Aberdeen
But her parents did not like me
And now she feels much the same
If I'm writ on in your diary
Well blot out my name
'Cause there's changes in the ocean
And there's changes in the sea
And there's changes in my own true love
But there ain't no changin' me I am a roving gambler
I gamble down in town
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
I lay my money down
I lay my money down
I had not been in Washington
Many more weeks than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little girl
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me
She took me to her parlor
She cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in her mama's ear
""I love that gamblin' man
I love that gamblin' man
I love that gamblin' man.""
""Oh Mother, dear Mother
Why do you treat me so?
The love I feel for the gamblin' man
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell.""
""Oh daughter, dear daughter
Old mother
With a gambler go
With a gambler go
With a gambler go.""
Well, I've gambled down in Washington
I gambled down in Spain
I'm going down to Georgia
To gamble my last game
To gamble my last game
To gamble my last game
Brakes on for Atlanta
I am a roving gambler
I've gambled down in town
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
I lay my money down
I lay my money down
I had not been in Washington
For many more weeks than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little girl
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Lie-la-lie ...
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Lie-la-lie ...
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rocking evenly
And I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be
But that's not unusual
No, it isn't strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are
More or less the same
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains
Lie-la-lie ... Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa

Oh-oh, motorcycle
Well, I got around on a red motorcycle
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa)
And a day after school, I'm a motorcycle fool
Riding with my baby, don't you know I'm real cool
Goin' yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, motorcycle
Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa

Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Oh-oh, motorcycle
Come on with me baby on my red motorcycle
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa)
From here all around to the other side of town
Everywhere you go there's a motorcycle sound
Goin' yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, motorcycle
Goin' 'round and around on my red motorcycle
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa)
Well, the way that I go everybody's gonna know
That you can't catch a motorcycle when he wants to go
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, motorcycle
Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Brrrrmm, pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa-pa
Oh-oh, motorcycle Listen to my story
It's got an happy ending
It's dedicate to you dear
Is the song I'm sending
Cha la la la la...
Every nigth I settle in my room
Feeling the silent gloom of my lonely heart
And the boys cries out from deep inside of me
Why don't you cry o little boy cry
So I cry cry cry
Wow I cry cry cry
Wow I cry cry cry
Little boy cry
All alone in this world
With that a lot of the girl
Sometimes I felt that I could not go on
And everywhere I went
That boy inside of me
Keep sayin' cry blue boy cry
So I cry cry cry
Wow I cry cry cry
Wow I cry cry cry
Little boy cry
That's darling I met you

No I won't cry cry cry
I won't cry cry cry
I won't cry cry cry

No I won't cry cry cry When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks better in black and white
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville
A Cadillac rollin' on the open road
But nothing will outrace my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
Bumper to bumper and side by side
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
The heat cooled down, the motor cooled down
That's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead
Hundred and ten half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's standin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing those things you used to do Are you going to scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(On the side of a hill in a deep forest green)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown)
Without no seams nor needle work
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl
Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me
From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies
And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should
For in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin
Or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns
That can scarcely be controlled You don't know that you love me
You don't know but I know that you do
You may think you're above me, yeah
What you think isn't always true
Don't try to debate me
You should know that I'm womanly wise
Still you try to manipulate me
You don't know where your interest lies
No, you don't know where your interest lies
You don't begin to comprehend
You're just a game I like to play
You may think that we're friends all right
But I won't let friendship get in my way
No, I won't let friendship get in my way
Indications indicate running the same riff will turn you around
Obviously you're going to blow it
But you don't know it
You don't know that you love me
You don't know but I know that you do
You may think that you're above me, yeah
What you think isn't always true
Don't try to debate me
You should know that I'm womanly wise
Still you try to manipulate me
You don't know where your interest lies
No, you don't know where your interest Simon And Garfunkel

A life times worth of lies What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on
And when you ran to me, your
Cheeks flashed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you girl
Oh, how I love you! My story really begins a month ago
That's when I first saw you
You're eyes were aglow
And then I could see (and then I could see)
That you were for me
I go to sleep at night and dream of you
I wish I could hold you tight the whole night through
But when I'm away (my heart too just pray)
I can't tell you I love you (too-too-too-wah)
My friends all tell me that I'm not the same
Always moody and blue
But they don't understand that I'm not to blame
I'm so (I'm so) in love (in love) with you
Oh Lord above, please hear my prayer
Show me where she is and take me there
One moment alone (one moment alone)
And we'll know we're in love
Ooh-ooh-ooh, that's my story Drea-ea-ea-ea-eam, dream, dream, dream
Drea-ea-ea-ea-eam, dream, dream, dream
When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Drea-ea-ea-ea-eam, dream, dream, dream
When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Drea-ea-ea-ea-eam
I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Drea-ea-ea-ea-eam, dream, dream, dream
Drea-ea-ea-ea-eam
I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?

They say that the left side of the brain
Controls the right
They say that the right side
Has to work hard all night
Maybe i think too much for my own good
Some people say so
Other people say no no
The fact is
You don't think as much as you could
Hmmm
I had a childhood that was mercifully brief
I grew up in a state of disbelief
I started to think too much
When i was twelve going on thirteen
Me and the girls from st. augustine
Up in the mezzanine
Thinking about god
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Have you ever experienced a period of grace
When your brain just takes a seat behind your face
And the world begins the elephant dance
Everything's funny
Everyone's sunny
You take out your money
And walk down the road
That leads me to the girl i love
The girl i'm always thinking of
But maybe i think too much
And i ought to just hold her
Stop trying to mold her
Maybe blindfold her
And take her away
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much They call me a fool
A teenage fool over you
They say you're plenty hung
But I'm still in love with you
Just a teenage fool
Who doesn't know the price you pay
Just a crazy fool
Who doesn't care what others say
Well, now they say that you play round with other boys
Well I guess that's just the way you are
Well, now you know, yeah, you know, that I'll never go
And I'll always love you so
When they see us going steady
Well, then they'll think we'll play it cool
If they still think that you don't love me
Well, then they're just some teenage fool
If they still think that you don't love me
Well, then they're just some teenage fool
Ah' ah-ah-ah' Ah' ah-ah-ah' Flame! that was her name
Being with Flame set me on fire
Her lips, sweeter than wine, clinging to mine
Taught me desire
She promised she'd always be right here in my arms
But I didn't know that this love of ours was sending out fire alarms
How I love you?
Flame! left as she came
All of my tears can't put out the Flame
She promised she'd always be right here in my arms
But I didn't know that this love of ours was sending out fire alarms
How I love you?
Flame! left as she came
All of my tears can't put out the Flame In a vine covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows
'Tis that silver haired daddy of mine
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
Oh, I know it's too late, dear old daddy
To repay all those sorrows and cares
Though dear mother is waiting in heaven
Just to comfort and solace you there
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine Tom, get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Doh-n-doh-de-doh-n-doh
And here I am
The only living boy in New York
I get the news I need
On the weather report
Oh, I can gather all the news I need
On the weather report
Hey, I've got nothing to do today
But smile, de-doh-n-doh-de-doh
And here I am
The only living boy in New York
Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where
And we don't know where
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Here I am
Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where
And we don't know where
Tom, get your plane right on time
I know that you've been eager to fly now
Hey let your honesty shine, shine, shine now
Doh-n-doh-de-doh-n-doh
Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Here I am
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Here I am Here is my song for the asking
Ask me and I will play
So sweetly, I'll make you smile
This is my tune for the taking
Take it, don't turn away
I've been waiting all my life
Thinking it over, I've been sad
Thinking it over, I'd be more than glad
To change my ways for the asking
Ask me and I will play
All the love that I hold inside Time, time, time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside's, it's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned, carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Oh hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high, the fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life
Oh seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me at any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme, drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye love, goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island
I've built walls
A fortress steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
Its laughter and its loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one, and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries In my little town I grew up believing
God keeps His eye on us all
And He used to lean upon me
As I pledged allegiance to the wall
Lord, I recall my little town
Coming home after school
Flying my bike past the gates of the factories
My mom doin' the laundry
Hangin' our shirts in the dirty breeze
And after it rains theres a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
Its not that the colors arent there
Its just imagination they lack
Everythings the same
Back in my little town
My little town, my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
In my little town I never meant nothing
I was just my father's son
Saving my money, dreamin' of glory
Twitching like a finger on the trigger of a gun
Leaving nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town Chorus:
Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
Whoah and I know a man, he came from my hometown
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said dolores, I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering, I'm afraid that I will disappear
Chorus
I know a woman, (who) became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day is when I lie in the bed
And I think of things that might have been
Chorus
And I know a father who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
He came a long way just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and he headed home again
Chorus
Whoah God only knows, God makes his plan
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway, when in fact we're slip sliding away
Chorus repeats 2x (Spoken)
(Art:)
Paul and I go back to the sixth grade when we grew up in Queens. They cast the two of us in the elementary school graduation play Alice in Wonderland. I was the Cheshire Cat, and it's been a lot of laughs ever since. With a few interruptions this would be the fiftieth anniversary of this friendship that I deeply cherish
(Paul:)
We met when we were eleven years old in Alice in Wonderland and I was the White Rabbit – it’s a leading role – and Artie was the Cheshire Cat – it was a supporting role, a very important, very important supporting role. Now, we started to sing together when we were thirteen years old, and we started to argue when we were fourteen years old. So that makes this the forty-seventh anniversary of our arguing
(Art:)
Now we only argued about one thing if you want to know the truth, from the very beginning, there was only one thing that was the basis of everything else: when we first formed our group I wanted to call us Garfunkel and Simon
(Paul:)
You should do that. Now we don’t argue any more. Now we say, ...now we say: that’s your opinion and I respect that. We made our first record when we were sixteen years old. They called us Tom & Jerry, and our song was called ""Hey School Girl in the Second Row"", and it went like this... I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song
I'm twenty-two now but I won't be for long
Time hurries on
And the leaves that are green turned to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl
I held her close but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write
And the leaves that are green turned to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand
I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound
And the leaves that are green turned to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
That's all there is
And the leaves that are green turned to brown Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand pеople, maybe more
Pеople talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence"" (paul simon)
The smartest people in the world
Had gathered in los angeles
To analyze our love affair
And possibly unscramble us
And we sat among our photographs
Examined every one
And in the end we compromised
And met the morning sun
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
They say the left side of the brain
Dominates the right
And the right side has to labor
Through the long and speechless night
And in the night
My father came to me
And held me to his chest
He said there's not much more that you can do
Go on and get some rest
And i said yeah
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much
Maybe i think too much Why don't you write me
I'm out in the jungle
I'm hungry to hear you
Send me a card
I am waiting so hard
To be near you
(La, la, la)
Why don't you write?
Something is wrong
And I know I got to be there
Maybe I'm lost
But I can't make the cost
Of the airfare, ooh
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)
Why don't you write me
A letter would brighten
My loneliest evening
Mail it today
If it's only to say
That you're leaving me
(La, la, la)
Monday morning, sitting in the sun
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come
Tuesday, never got a word
Hm
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign
Drank a half a bottle of iodine
Friday, woe is me
Gonna hang my body from the highest tree
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me? Do people have a tendency to dump on you?
Does your group have more cavities than theirs?
Do all the hippies seem to get the jump on you?
Do you sleep alone when other sleep in pairs?
Well, there's no need to complain, we'll eliminate your pain
We can neutralize your brain, you'll feel just fine now
Buy a big, bright green pleasure machine
Do figures of authority just shoot you down?
Is life within the business world a drag?
Did your boss just mention that you'd better shop around
To find yourself a more productive bag?
Are you worried and distressed, can't seem to get no rest
Put our product to the test. you'll feel just fine now
Buy a big, bright green pleasure machine
You better hurry up and order one
Our limited supply is very nearly gone
Do you nervously await the blows of cruel fate?
Do your checks bounce higher than a rubber ball?
Are you worried 'cause your girlfriend's just a little late?
Are you looking for a way to chuck it all?
We can end your daily strife at a reasonable price
You've seen it advertised in Life, you'll feel just fine now
Buy a big, bright green pleasure machine So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
I can't believe your song is gone so soon
I barely learned the tune so soon, so soon
I'll remember Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize 'til dawn
I never laughed so long, so long, so long
Architects may come and architects may go
And never change your point of view
When I run dry, I stop awhile and think of you
Architects may come and architects may go
And never change your point of view
So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize 'til dawn
I never laughed so long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long, so long
So long, so long Here is my song for the asking
Ask me and I will play
So sweetly, I'll make you smile
This is my tune for the taking
Take it, don't turn away
I've been waiting all my life
Thinking it over, I've been sad
Thinking it over, I'd be more than glad
To change my ways for the asking
Ask me and I will play
All the love that I hold inside
Hm
Hm I am a citizen of the planet
I was born here
I'm going to die here
Come what may
I am entitled by my birth
To the treasures of the earth
No one must be denied these
No one must be denied
Easy dreams
At the end of a chain-smokin' day
Easy dreams at the end of the day
Who am I to believe
That the future we perceive
Lies in danger and the dangers increase
Who are we to demand
That the leaders of the land
Hear the voices of reason and peace
We are the citizens of the planet
We were born here
We're going to die here
Come what may
We are entitled by our birth
To the treasures of the earth
No one must be denied these
No one must be denied
Easy dreams at the end of a chain-smokin' day
Easy dreams at the end of the day
Who am I to deny
What my eyes can clearly see
And raise a child with a flame in his heart
Who are we to believe
That these thoughts are so naive
When we've all disagreed from the start
We are the citizens of the planet
We were born here
We're gong to die here
Come what may
We are entitled by our birth
To the treasures of the earth
No one must be denied these
No one must be denied
Easy dreams at the end of a chain-smokin' day
Easy dreams at the end of the day Hello darkness, my old friend
