"Heto mi halanma
Mine waddimi yiddema
Ko ane tane holimi
Holimi ko ndjidirmi o Dunne Dunne
Hum hum waddimi yidde

In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have

Humm ko ane holimi
Koliyo ngopei ndjoukirade
Hasidagal modiani
Waddimi yiddema
Waddimi yiddema
Mine waddimi yiddema
Ko ane tane rokimi
Ko nanei nanei nanei nanei nanei mi waddno
Ko jonni jonni jonni jonni jonni mi watti
Ko jonni jonni jonni jonni jonni mi watti

So open up my eyes to a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night
But I lift up my eyes to a new high
And indeed there would be time

In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have
In the cold light I live, I only live for you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

There is a time, a time to love
A time to sing, a time to shine
A time to leave, a time to stay
There is a time, a time to cry
A time to love, a time to live
There is a time, a time to sing
A time to love

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling? Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

Haa-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear? Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground


Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again You hold it, in your hands
And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again
Alone, In the compromise of truth

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you leave it open?

And the stakes remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don’t leave a love divine
Its a water tight excuse

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you will always be danger

How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit that greets you in the night
With snake eyes, the most precious kind

It's in the eyes!
I can tell, you will always be danger!
We had it tonight! Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes!
I can tell you will always be danger! 1, 2, 3

All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright

But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you

But don’t just slip away in the night
And don’t just hurl your words from on high

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don’t just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

If we come back and we’re broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we’ll go your way

'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light It's in my blood, it's in my water
You try to tame me, tame me from the start
When the din is in your eye, flash your flesh
Desperate for a need to rise

With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
In the place that's safe from harm
I had been blessed with a wilder mind

You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want

Beholden now I find myself awake
Waiting on the edge again
You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends

With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
In the place that's safe from harm
I had been blessed with a wilder mind

You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want

But I thought we believed in an endless love
But I thought we believed in an endless love You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind Woman
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

And I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again

I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time, oh-oh-ohh
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again, oh-oh-ohh
I am left in awe of the woman I adore

Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

But say the sun doesn't shine for you
I hope you learn that that's not true, in time
When you're gone again
Just as long again

I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again
But I am left in awe of the woman I adore
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
But as the night ascends, all will slow again
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet Serve God, love me and mend
This is not the end
Live unbruised, we are friends
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Sigh no more, no more
One foot in sea, one on shore
My heart was never pure
You know me, you know me

But man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing

Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be Wide eyed, with a heart made full of fright
Your eyes follow like tracers in the night
And the tightrope, that you wander every time
You have been weighed you have been found wanting

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for


Shelter, you better keep the wolf back from the door
He wanders ever closer every night
And how he waits, baying for blood
I promised you everything would be fine

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for


Hold my gaze love, you know I want to let it go
We will stare down at the wonder of it all
And I will hold you in it
And I will hold you in it

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to look you in the eye
'Cause you were all I ever longed for

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
And oh babe, can you tell what’s on my tongue?
Can you guess that I’ll be gone?
With the twilight
With the twilight

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't

Oh babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you lie
One last time
Just one last time
But oh babe, I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't
And we can talk it round again girl
Round and round, round and round again
Or we could leave it all tonight
Leave it all just leave it all

I never tried to trick you babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
Cause I just want to hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind


But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't they say they don't And in time
As one reminds the other of the past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?
A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time
And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one

Careful hands
And wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
And now I'm losing you And after the storm
I run and run as the rains come
And I look up, I look up
On my knees and out of luck
I look up
Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot

And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall
And remembered our own land
What we lived for

But there will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair

And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more
That's why I hold
That's why I hold with all I have
That's why I hold

And I won't die alone
And be left there
Well I guess I'll just go home
Oh God knows where
Because death is just so full
And man so small
Well I'm scared of what's behind
And what's before

There will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
And there will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair Do not lie to us
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
Tell your stories, tell of your pain
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep

But what have I if I have not love?
I am a waste
My words are empty vessels if I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me I think we'll find a way
And walk with me I think we'll find a way

But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
What's behind, I can clearly see
But that beyond, that's beyond me

When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
And does your love prefer the other?
And does your love just make you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?

When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
When it's all just dust to dust
And how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me

Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?

When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good? Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body?
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly?
And can you kneel before the king
And say, ""I'm clean, I'm clean""?

But tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention
But denied my affections, my affections

So tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

Lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Oh, lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Har, har, har, har, har
Har, har, har... Touch my mouth and hold my tongue
I’ll never be your chosen one
I’ll be home, safe and tucked away
You can’t tempt me if I don’t see the day
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
Stifles the choice and the air in my lungs
Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
Cause when I open my body I breathe a lie
I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot
And oh, my heart was flawed I knew my weakness
So hold my hand, consign me not to darkness
So crawl on my belly ‘til the sun goes down
I’ll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I can take the road and I can fuck it all away
But in this twilight, our choices seal our fate ‘Cause I know that time has numbered my days
And I’ll go along with everything you say
But I’ll ride home laughing, look at me now
The walls of my town, they come crumbling down
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love

'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask
(Woo!)

Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down
Well, I’m gonna tear, tear them down

'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under So we were out
Thowin' dice in the dark
I saw you late, last night, come to harm
I saw you dance, in the devil's arms
The night kept coming
Really nothing I could do
Eyes with a fire, unquenched, by peace
Cass the beauty, Cass the queen
So we come
To a place of no return
Yours is the face, which makes my body burn
And here is the name, that our sons will learn:
Cass the beauty, Cass the queen
Cass the beauty, lead me
So when you're weak
When you are on your knees
I'll do my best, with the time, that's left
Swan with your spirit, you are fully flesh
So fuck your dreams
Don't you pick at our seams
I'll turn into a monster for you, if you pay me enough
None of this counts, if you just, plough it up
So we come
To a place of no return
Yours is the face, which makes my body burn
And here is the name, that our sons will learn:
Cass the beauty, Cass the queen
Cass the beauty, lead me How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

Awake my soul
Awake my soul

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love
You invest your life

Yeah
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker I came here without a choice
I'm sorry I could never thank you
For saving me more trouble
I didn't want any trouble
If you were given one more chance
Would you bring me back to life?
Bring me back into the light
Into the light

But let it shine on, let it shine on us

And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you

The innocence in your face bled out without a trace
You've won without an enemy, you're ill without a remedy
As night bleeds into night, and I know I came off better than you
It doesn't mean that I feel better
It doesn't mean that I feel better

And let it shine on, let it shine on us

And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you
And if I say I love you, well then I love you

Show me your hands
Are they cleaner than mine?
Show me your face
Did you cross the line?
Show me your eyes
They any drier than mine?
Your soul survives
But peace, you'll never find

And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
And if I say I love you, well, then I love you Where do I turn to when there's no choice to make?
How do I presume when there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all
What if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
If this is our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
Well I've been running from the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself but how can I forget
There's a stain on it all
But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
We had it all
If this is our time now
We wanna see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
So give us a sign
I need some guiding light
Children of darkness, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh There is no great thing, to stop and sing
Waiting for the rain
And this perfect pill, it's all too much
On the edge again
Don't look away
Couldn't help but note the coldest thing
In your precious face
Why do you always speak when you have no grace
In your precious face

But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol
Though you swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive

Another fragile edge, and a tender sound
And then you went aground
Near a duller blade, a promise out of sight
There's nothing here for you tonight

But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol
Though you swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive

Let my blood only run out when my world decides
There is no way out of your only life
So run on, run on! Cold is the water
It freezes your already cold mind
Already cold, cold mind
And death is at your doorstep
And it will steal your innocence
But it will not steal your substance

But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand

And you are the mother
The mother of your baby child
The one to whom you gave life
And you have your choices
And these are what make man great
His ladder to the stars

But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand

And I will tell the night
Whisper, ""Lose your sight""
But I can't move the mountains for you Lyrics in the main body of text are for the UK version

You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
And broken glass saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals (next to yours)
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours (on the coals)

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold with all of my might (as long as you like)
Just promise me we'll be all right

Ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life Loneliness and all
I was stuck to the spot without a friend
Alone again
And I hunger and I thirst
For some shiver
For some whispered words
And a promise to come

And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end

I didn't fool you but I failed you
In short, made a fool out of you
And a younger heart
And I rage and I rage
But perhaps I will come of age
And be ready for you

And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end Weekend wreckers take the streets
With abandon in their eyes
But in our bedroom we're bloodshot and beat
And never so alive

And I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
We'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again

Now look at you all torn up
I left you waiting to bleed
I guess the truth works two ways
Maybe the truth's not what we need

But in my cold arms
You don't sleep
In my cold arms
Your fear beats
In my cold arms
You stay Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside

See you told me that I would find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But, you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home
That will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with the restart

""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

Stars, hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
Hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul

But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over
I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward
I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up -- breathe in, breathe out

And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
 x2 The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart will never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son"" Rip the earth in two with your mind
Seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm
But close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
How can you say that your truth is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we carry no arms
The blind man sleeps in the doorway, his home
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
Close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won
You've won
Well now you've won
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
Well now you've won
But I gave you all You don't wanna turn away this time
Then why don't you take a different line
Don't have to be cruel to be kind
You don't have to lose your mind
You don't wanna suffer for your art
You don't wanna vivisect your heart
And then if you're falling apart
You're probably trying too hard

In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless


You don't wanna say what you don't mean
You still want to paint a figure scene
You hide in the wings with a lamp
And cast the shadows on a screen
You don't wanna sing what you can say
Well that's quite a hard game to play
But I have fallen for your ways
In spite of myself I don't want you to change

But in the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless

Wona, 
Wona
Wona, 
Wona
Wona, 
Wona
Wona, 
Wona, 

In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless

And I will be yours (wona, )
And you will be mine (wona)
And I will be yours (wona, )
And you will be mine (wona, ) Fold your hair behind your ears
Roll your questions across the floor
I know we've been here for years
But at least we been here before
My mind finds peace in the shade of your attention
But gets tangled by the night
I didn’t know what I was thinking
But I know we'll be alright

And I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon

Come crashing in like a wildfire, I’m left in awe of you
Every time I close the door, I'm left wanting more of you
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now
I don't know another way

When it's said and done
I am yours forever
Like I said, I'm done
I am yours forever

I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
Long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon

With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever Well love was kind
For a time
Now just aches
And it makes me blind
This mirror holds
My eyes too bright
I can't see
The others in my life
Were we too young
Our heads too strong
To bear the weight
Of these lovers' eyes
Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse
Of these lovers' eyes

But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
Cause there's no drink
Or drug I've tried
To rid the curse of
These lovers' eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong

But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way Tell my thoughts to resign
And lift you from my mind
I'm not ready, I'm not strong enough
To cradle the weight of your love
Just take a minute, take a breath
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
I saw a flicker then just smoke
But as you left I was calling your name at the night

I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young

I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me
So I'll be a shadow of the flame
I leant down to kiss you then erased my name
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long

The flame burnt out in our empty hands
But now I see it's got nothing to do
It's got nothing to do with you

I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young

(Why do I keep falling) I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling) And young love would keep us young
(Why do I keep falling) I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling) And young love would keep us young As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no
This time no""
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no""
Yes, my heart told my head
""This time no
This time no""
Oh the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
Was the same that sent me into your arms
Oh, and Pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
And no hope, no hope will overcome
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no""

And my head told my heart
""Let love grow""
But my heart told my head
""This time no
This time no"" We came to the end it seems you had heard
As we walked the city streets you never said a word
When we finally sat down your eyes were full of spite
I was desperate, I was weak, I could not put up a fight

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

You were strangely less in pain than you were cold
Triumphant in your mind of the logic that you hold
You said no one would ever know the love that we had shared
As I took my leave to go it was clear you didn't care

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

And I hear of your coming and your going in the town
I hear stories of your smile, I hear stories of your frown
And the darkness can descend we can relish all the pain
But I know that's what you love cause you know I love the same

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd? Broad-shouldered beasts fill the sky
Manhattan beats at the night
But you are wrapped up in wire
Curled up in fright
So I took you to the city for the night
To dance under dizzy silver lights
But for a moment, you were wild
With abandon like a child, just a moment

But wasn't it you who said I was not free
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all

But it's alright
Take it out on me
But it's alright
Take it out on me

These apartment walls are paper thin
And no one is trying to listen in
What to hear our doubts
Hear our whispered shouts, they don't care

Wasn't it you who said I was not free
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all

But it's alright
Take it out on me
But it's alright
Take it out on me

But when you feel the world wrapping round your neck
Feel my hand round yours
And when you feel the world wrapping round your neck
Don't succumb

But it's alright
Take it out on me
But it's alright
Take it out on me
But it's alright
Take it out on me You were cold
As the blood through your bones
And the light which led us from our chosen homes
Well I was lost
And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
And I was still
But I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus all was well
For all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
Wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn My generation's stuck in the mirror
""Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word""
I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard
And I am afraid of that which I do not know
So why don't I just ask your fucking name?
Justice just gets buried in a white light
I heard there was a time you'd call it shame

So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here

Your cynicism buys me no more time here
Imagine my relief to hit the walls
Running from the weight of ancient labels
And leaving what identity there was
Well, my generation's stuck in the mirror
""Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word""
And I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard

So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here

Let's raise our hands for a moment
And leave it all behind
Don't be afraid for a moment
The blind leading the blind


So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here We saw birth and death
Can't we be still
What makes you kind
From where comes your sparkling mind

Was it under the earth
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot you were ever there

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid

What’s that I see?
I think it's The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me

It was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love

What's that I see?
I think it’s The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me Mortal once again
Making out what's make-pretend
And you whisper words forbidden
To see if I've been listening
Well, now I'm listening

We won't both get our way
If we do, it won't be tonight anyway
So I hold you by the jaw
And kiss you to be sure
With so much more than before

It took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance

I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway

I guess I asked for the truth
I guess I asked for it brutal and untuned
But tonight, it sounds improvised
Whatever has you so inspired
Well, I know you're inspired

And no one is better armed
To tear me down with a sleight of the tongue
And I could do the same
And see how long you can keep face
Let's see you keeping face

But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance

I wouldn't have it any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway
I wouldn't have you any other way
I don't want a love that makes sense anyway

But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With her everlasting glance In the silver light
I just made out
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
By wandering eyes
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have faith for the rest
I'm blinded by the lights
Of October Skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I am free
But in the hills I soar
Until your silhouette
Is gone once more
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have hope once more
The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
Let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oh let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have hope once more If I could tell you no
I thought it best you didn't know
Don't see it coming
The darkness visible
But when its eyes fix mine
It's silver and it's stone
I feel it rising, oh
The gathering storm

And when I feel that darkness is a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to hide it
It's a heartbeat away

And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you

And the night falls fast
I know it's heavy on the skin
Will it be ever thus
Barely visible
But when your eyes fix mine
Embracing your denial
Well I hold my breath
Through the waste and the wild

When I feel it rising
And it's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away

And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you No more questions no more lies
Do a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

Waiting patient for the sun to rise
It reveals a stoic smile
But you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

You'll find me waiting here for you
Come and suffer here
You'll find me holding my breath for you
Come and suffer here

In the violence of a mind's eye
We had a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you

You'll find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way

Go gently now
Be still
And love
Go gently now
Be still
And love
Go gently now
Be still

You find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way

But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
And you're not yourself
I know you better than you Your eyes they tie
Me down so hard
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love
My candle bright
Learn me hard, oh learn me right
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
Though I may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength
From which to speak
When you sit me down, and see I'm weak

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

So as we walked
Through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke
I was on my knees
But you said yes as I said please
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
I leave no ties
For a cynics mind

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
And I will love with urgency but not with haste I know I've had you troubled
And I know I've seared your mind
But you know that I love you
And that our love's not blind
And sure my dreams lie with you
But I've many more besides
And if I can't see them through
Our love will slowly die

So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your—dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your—dare I say forever

And I've known pious women
Who have led such secret lives
Shameless in the dark, so shameful in the light
And you may not be pious and I may not be saved
But we could live quite happily and quietly unfazed

So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your—dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your—dare I say forever

I was dreaming of the Liffey
I was thinking of the Thames
And now the East River flows by to the same end
Are we too sentimental to not look back and stare?

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your—dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your—dare I say forever Spare me your judgements and spare me your dreams
Cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
I sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind
Alone in the wind and the rain you left me
It's getting dark darling, too dark to see
And I'm on my knees, and your faith in shreds, it seems

Corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
I know you have felt much more love than you've shown
And I'm on my knees and the water creeps to my chest

But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill
Rain down, rain down on me

But I will hold on
I will hold on hope
But I will hold on
I will hold on hope
Oh I will hold on
I will hold on hope
But I will hold on
I will hold on hope
I will hold on
I will hold on

I begged you to hear me, there's more than flesh and bones
Let the dead bury the dead, they will come out in droves
But take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes you've made

But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me Don't let me darken your door
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for
And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong

A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't fade away
So watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your lights always shining on
And I been traveling oh so long
I been traveling oh so long

A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't' fade away
Oh my love don't fade away So I was lost, go count the cost
Before you go to the Holland Road
With your heart like a stone you spared no time in lashing out
And I knew your pain and the effect of my shame
But you cut me down, you cut me down
And I will not tell the thoughts of hell
That carried me home from the Holland Road
With my heart like a stone and I put up no fight
To your calloused mind, and from your corner you rose
To cut me down, you cut me down
So I hit my low, but little did I know
That would not be the end
From the Holland Road
Well I rose and I rose and I paid less time
To your calloused mind, and I wished you well
As you cut me down, you cut me down
But I still believe though these cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you believe in me I'll still believe
But I still believe though these cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you believe in me I'll still believe There to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
Rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded, though immortal: But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
At once, as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all: but torture without end
Still urges
As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible You hold your truth so purely
And swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved
Under this sun!
Under this sun!

And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head; let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears
What he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway stations running scared
Laying low seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come on
From the whores on seventh avenue
I do declare there were times
When I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Then I'm laying down my winter clothes
And wishing I was home going home
Where the New York City winters
Are bleeding me, bleeding me going home
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminder of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving but the fighter still remains You search all your life
Stealing all you find
And you stare at your own hands
Not the hands they entwine




You have all you need
When you're held by me
Don't pine for what's not
And whatever will be
You have all you need
When you're held by me
Don't pine for what's not
And whatever will be Wazuza moyo wanga ah
Tsiku lina n’zatopa
N’zapita kwa makol’anga

And I
Downtown head and high rise eyes
So naive to how the skyline lies
Must do nothing for your mind

And I’ll love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't matter I'm cold
Doesn't matter I'm toothless
Doesn't matter my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you’ve landed
But a fool you call home

Eh, taona moyo wako iwe
Ulibe n’chisoni chomwe
Mtima wako n’wa chabe-chabe

And you
Amazed you held my gaze so long
With you're down-home heart and skirt undone
Stand by the man that you call home

I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't matter I'm cold
Doesn't matter I'm toothless
Doesn't matter my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you’ve landed
But a fool you call home

Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze I lit out from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my hearts delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight Si tu ne veux pas tu vas chez toi
Ou bien je vais chez moi

Si tu veux tu viens chez moi
Ou bien on va chez toi

Si tu vas tu verra
Si tu vas tu verra


Si tu vas tu verra
Si tu vas tu verra
Si tu vas tu verra I... I can't promise you that I won't let you down
And I... I can't promise you that I will be the only one around
When your hope falls down
But we're young
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
And love, this city breathes the plague of loving things more than
Their Creators

I ran away, I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast, casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make
But if I was wrong? What if I was wrong?
Oh what if I was wrong?

But hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

Now this land means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn, the water runs away from me
The halo disappears, I'm not whole when you're not here
So what if I was wrong? What if I was wrong?
Oh what if I was wrong?

But hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

Hold on to what you believed
In the light Just give me a second, darling, to clear my head
Just put down those scissors, baby
On the single bed
The sand in the hour glass is running low
I came through thunder, the cold wind, the rain and the snow
To find you awake by your window sill
A sight for sore eyes, and a view to kill
I broke down in horror at you standing there
The glow from the moon shone through cracks in your hair
I shouted with passion ""I love you so much""
But feeling my skin, it was cold to the touch
You whispered ""Where are you?""
I questioned your doubt
But soon realized you were talking to God now
But you've got blood your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to
I looked in the mirror, but something was wrong
I saw you behind, but my reflection was gone
There was smoke in the fireplace as white as the snow
A voice beckoned gently ""Now it's time to go""
A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness
""Don't touch me!"" I screamed
""I've got unfinished business.""
But you've got blood your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to
But you've got blood your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
And there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to I ran away in floods of shame
I'll never tell how close I came
As I cross the Holland road
You went left and I went right
As the moon hung proud and white
You would have loved it here tonight
Spin me round just to pin me down
On the cover of this strange bed
Spin me round just to pin me dowm
Roll out your questions keep them down
Let the water lead us home
And I was sorry for what I'd done
You were young I was not old
But our story was not told
But torn apart by greedy hands
Spin me round just to pin me down
On the cover of this strange bed
Spin me round just to pin me down
Spin me round just to pin me down
I'll be gone by the nights end
Spin me round just to pin me down
But I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home
And I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home
And I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home
And I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home She was darkened but light-headed, a daydream
Earning from her eyes down to her knees

With some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Some kind of love

I'll be the devil in your eye if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye if it'll change the way you feel

Hold my breath, I know it's me you're gonna blame
Blame my mother, blame my mood, it's all the same

Some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Just some kind of love

I'll be the devil in your eye if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye if it'll change the way you feel

That's some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
(Some kind of love, some kind of love)
(Some kind of love, some kind of love) Helpless she lies across the stairs
Haunting your days, consuming your prayers
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands

You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
Called to be a rock for those below
Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat is that healing that you're hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of a man who's built his life on love

I'll be locked up and stored
In the lavender ward
Cause my mind is just like hers
Just as broken just as crippled just as burned
And then I find myself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be a rock for those below I know that things are broken
And though there's too many words left unsaid
You say that you have spoken
Like the coward I am, I hang my head
You lie careless your head on my chest
Don't even look at me looking my best
And all these things I can't describe
You would rather I didn't try

But please don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar
Oh please, don't cry, you liar

And you lean in for your last kiss
Who in this world could ask me to resist?
Your hands cold as they find my neck
Oh this love that I've find, I detest 1,2,3

I know I've had you troubled
And I know I've seared your mind
But you know that I love you
And that our love's not blind
And sure my dreams lie with you
But I've many more besides
And if I can't see them through
Our love will slowly die

So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your (Whoo!) dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your (Whoo!) dare I say forever

And I've known pious women
Who have led such secret lives
Shameless in the dark, so shameful in the light
And you may not be pious and I’m afraid that I’m not saved
But we could live quite happily and quietly unfazed

So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your (Whoo!) dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your (Whoo!) dare I say forever

I was dreaming of the Liffey
I was thinking of the Thames
And now the East River flows by to the same end
And as they all roll past us they never stopped or cared
Are we too sentimental to not look back and stare?

So when you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your (Whoo!) dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your (Whoo!) dare I say forever She sits him down in a stiff chair
Rubs his back and strokes his hair
Telling him it's okay to cry but he just sits and stares
The merciless moon outside, has nothing now he's come to realize
Only the desolation he feels, the cold distance inside

But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
While the priest just sits and weeps
Lamenting the fact that he can see
Darkness and light in so much detail he has given himself over
Refusing what he knows to be real
Turns away from every meal
Starving himself of goodness
He don't think he can heal

But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
""What if I've lost all I had?""
Says the stranger to his dad
And the witness is confused
He can't tell what is bad
Instead he runs up to the nearest girl
And he comments on her glorious curls
Says, ""darling, come with me""
I'll show you a whole new world

But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
(Sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(Ooh)

I never realized the passing hours of evening showers
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye-bye
(Ooh)

And I would have walked head on
Into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye-bye

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight) Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I am not the enemy
It isn't me, the enemy

But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below

But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling? She stole my heart and made me sing
She tore me limb from limb
I did not think that I could love
Or be loved that way again
Again, again
How glad I was to be myself
And use my heart once more
How glad I was to be a man
And love that girl that I adore
Adore, adore
Well my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again
Oh my eyes shall see light again
And my heart shall bleed right again
Har-har, har-har-har! There's a chip on your shoulder, girl
And by God it'll make you fall
If you let it take a part of your soul
I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

Cause your roots will rot away
And your fruit, it won't grow
Your bark will wear thin, body hollow
I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister don't test the ones you love
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us

Don't test the ones you love
It'll only tear us down
If you want to feel alive
Then learn to love your ground

Love your ground
Sister don't let go
Sister don't let go of us I will not fall
Once more I'm called
Time comes for all
Then dark is whole
But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness
I will not speak of your sin
There is a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are shot
But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness
But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness
And I fall short
And I fall short
And I fall short
And I fall short
But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Subscribe me not to darkness Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you’ll hear your sister sleep talking
Say, “Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be”
And she woke up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two-cent coins that are no good no more
She’ll lay it aside
{Mumford & Sons]
Older father, weary soul, you’ll drive
Out to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings
And you’ll find somebody you can blame
And you’ll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you’ll find the peace of the Lord

Grandfather, weary soul, you’ll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You’ve waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

Oh the only woman you ever loved
She got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and ran into her body and her blood
And there’s nothing that you can do about it now How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free

Har har, har har
Har har, har har

Awake my soul
Awake my soul

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show

Har har, har har
Har har, har har

In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love, you invest your life
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love, you invest your life
(Hey!)


Awake my soul
Awake my soul

For you were made to meet your maker
Come on Denver!
Awake my soul, awake my soul
You were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker
Ah-ah Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing
Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
‘Til morning comes, let's tessellate
Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart
Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One bird, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to the seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me
Triangles are my favorite shapes
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
‘Til morning comes, let's tessellate Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart
Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart
Where are my ears, girl
Where are my ears
Did you go ahead and shave them off when you shaved off my beard
You know that without them my head look kinda weird
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where are my ears
Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart
Where is my tongue, girl
Where is my tongue
Did you go ahead and suck it out when you sucked out my lungs
You know that without it my song can't be sung
I'm not joking anymore girl where is my tongue
Beers, browns, and banjos
Is that all I need
I looked up at the sky and I got down on my knees
Oh lord for Christmas won't you find me a wife
I will play her my banjo and she'll give me a life
Where is my heart, girl
Where is my heart
Did you throw it in a blender or throw it beneath a car
Did you give it to a doctor to dissect apart
I'm not joking anymore girl
Where is my heart 1, 2, 3
Well, I came home, like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
So break my step, and relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way shake the excess
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, know my ground
Now I'll remold
This one is strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
Tethered mind, free from the light
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, know my ground
I'll kneel down, wait for now
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
To keep my heart slow
And raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
And broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside, my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be all right

So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be all right


But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours

So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold on with all of my might
Just promise me we'll be all right

The ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life One, two
One, two, three, four
Yeah

Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way, shake the excess

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind free from the lies

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground


Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
Well, thank you very much! One, two, three, go!

Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
And weep, little lion man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Or rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And wasted on fixing all the problems that you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I...


Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble, little lion man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?


Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, one, two

It was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

Hey! (Crowd screams)
Well love was kind, for a time
But now just aches and it makes me blind
This mirror holds my eyes too bright
I can't see the others in my life

Were we too young?
Our heads too strong?
To bear the weight of these lover's eyes
'Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse of these lover's eyes

But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord, forget all of my sins
Oh, let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lover's eyes

There's no drink nor drug I tried
To rid the curse of these lover's eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong

But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord, forget all of my sins
Oh, let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lover's eyes

And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, I'll be on my way


And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way


La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
Hello everyone, so much for the show There won’t be any Mumford & Sons activities for the foreseeable future following Friday’s show.

How long?

We have no idea. We just know we’re going to take a considerable amount of time off and just go back to hanging out and having no commitments or pressure or anything like that. It feels like the last week of school right now, before school holiday when you’re in high school. The atmosphere on the road is one of . . . I think everyone’s excited about being free of schedules.
We’re just going to rest up. I don’t think we’ve had actually much time in the process to be with other people and living a life outside of the band. I think that’s what’s in place at the moment, to do very little – especially when it comes to Mumford & Sons. You were cold
As the blood through your bones
And the light which led us
From our chosen homes
Well, I was lost
And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm, hmm

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

And I was still
But I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus, all was well
So all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
So wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Oh, keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn (Hey!)

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Cheers, thank you very much! It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again (Yeah!)


'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be
Come on Red Rocks!


And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again, hey-ey!

Thank you very much, for Mumford & Sons! Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired and shift
A whisper of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper, ""Darling, close the door""
Well, how have I not made a note of every word you ever said?
And time, is not on our side
But I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you

Are you afraid
However could you not be in this rosy light?
This is strange
I see a hand come through the mirror, pointing at the light

Before you leave you, must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back, beloved

We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes, love

And as you leave, you must know you are beloved
And as you leave, I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back, beloved
And as you leave, see my children playing at your feet You want that?


Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
Together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside


You told me that I would find a home
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals (Hey!)

And ""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see

It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home that'll change this heart
But the welcome I receive with every start (Yeah!)

""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
""Darkness"" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see


(Yeah) Stars hide your fires
For these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul, oh!

But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
Thank you very much! The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

One, two, three...

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time


Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
Oh, there will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time


Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""
Thank you very much! Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper, darling, close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said?
Time is not on our side
But I pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you

Are you afraid?
How ever could you not be?
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Pointing at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved

Will you sit
And talk the stars down from the sky?
Down there, forget the chaos in your eyes, love

And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave, I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave, see my children playing at your feet Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, my air
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, yeah

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I keep on breathin', oh yeah
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls
x2
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me
I don't even know if I (x4)

I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been


So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
I don't even know if I (x8) It's no slip of the tongue
So let it all out, let it all out
Don't you act like you're stunned
It didn't all come from me
Did it all come from me?
I'm red, I'm raring, I'm out of breath
Your burning stare holding down my chest, chest

So if this is love, love, love
Then why do you
You even bother?

Piercing words script the night
Then you force me to the floor
You pull me to the floor
But you won't see inside
This beating head, this wailing head

So if this is love, love, love
Then why do you
You even bother? You hold your truth so purely
Swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the Devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

But fingers tap into what you were once
Now I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark
I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad but I'm not a fraud
I'd set out to serve the Lord
But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I love
Under the sun!
Under the sun!

But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
Fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head
Let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young

         He was alone, outside
On the night his glory died, she just sat and cried
None of the rain that he’d longed for from her face
That’s the penance he could pay for his crime
So he took all he had and he ran
And he ran for his life, left his wife
And how he longed to be a child of the light
And for once in his life, he runs

Leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
For I will be ruled by my vices

So take your leave from the words
As they drip from the mouth of a child, soft and low
Run away from the sins of your rage
And the way you were made to take

Leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
'Cause I will be ruled by my vices

Oh, leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
'Cause I will be ruled by my vices
Oh, leave, leave me alone with my voices
And leave, leave me alone to my choices
'Cause I will be ruled by my vices Mumford & Sons played their last tour date supporting Babel last night in Bonner Springs, Kansas, ending a dramatic year that has included several Grammy wins and bassist Ted Dwane’s health scare – and the band revealed to Rolling Stone that they’re ready for a long break.
""There won’t be any Mumford & Sons activities for the foreseeable future following Friday’s show,"" keyboardist Ben Lovett told us earlier this week.
Exactly how long is the band planning to take off?
""We have no idea. We just know we’re going to take a considerable amount of time off and just go back to hanging out and having no commitments or pressure or anything like that. It feels like the last week of school right now, before school holiday when you’re in high school. The atmosphere on the road is one of . . . I think everyone’s excited about being free of schedules.""
Back in February, the band told us that learning to play demanding arena sets has been an adjustment.
""These shows take a bit more out of us,"" said Lovett. ""We have a bigger responsibility to be in better form. We can’t be dropping the set 20 minutes because Marcus has tired legs.""
Added Ted Dwane, ""We definitely want a little break. We’re going to have a little rest.""
It will be the band’s first true down time since breaking through with 2009's Sigh No More.
""We’re just going to rest up,"" Lovett says now. ""I don’t think we’ve had actually much time in the process to be with other people and living a life outside of the band. I think that’s what’s in place at the moment, to do very little – especially when it comes to Mumford & Sons."""
