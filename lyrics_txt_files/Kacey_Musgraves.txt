"When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Mmm
It'll all be alright I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you

Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies
Ooh, mmm, mmm

Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me

I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

Whatever feels good

Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burn You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
High horse
You ain’t ever gonna come down
You ain’t ever gonna come down It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up, goes up must come down
And I don't wanna come down
No, I don't wanna come down Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe

Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel

And these are real things
Yeah, these are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you

These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found

In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You had to get a little lost
On your way to being found

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found

All is found
All is found If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want

So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em

So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

Say what you think, love who you love
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
Only live once

So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points Taking down your neighbor won't take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire
I've never gotten taller making someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all

Just ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line

So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Pouring salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissing in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener
And I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes
So I'll just do me and, honey, you can just do you
(So, row)

So ho​e your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy Bursting with empathy
I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors

Wish we didn't live
Wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother
Mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother
Mother All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind of love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

I knew it as soon as I felt it
Mm-mm, I knew it as soon as I felt it
Yeah

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby, yeah You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you

Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun, mmm
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes
Sometimes

It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend I like where this is going
And you like it too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to

I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to

But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

Bet all that gold gets heavy
Weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary
Always tryin' not to get hurt

I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies

'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the truth out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'

You don't know how to fly, no
That's okay, neither do I

I know I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman Get a little drunk, get a little loud
Stupid me and my rebel mouth
Ain't all wrong but I ain't alright
Don't see the world in black and white
My grandma cried when I pierced my nose
I never liked doing what I was told
Don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause I ain't walkin' in your shoes

'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

And maybe he would sit awhile
And render me an illegal smile
And I bet that he would understand
Just how I feel and who I am

'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

And I play my life like truth or dare
I'm not all here but I'm all there, yeah
And all the colors people paint me
Don't they know they'll never change me, yeah

'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine
Yeah, my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine I've had my picture made with Willie Nelson
Stayed in a hotel with a pool
Driven through New Mexico where the saguaro cactus grow
And I felt really small under Mount Rushmore

And I made it all the way past Austin city limits
And maybe for a minute, I got too big for my britches, but

I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

Slept in a room with the ghost of Gram Parsons
Drank some wine I can't afford
Went to San Antonio to the River Walk and the rodeo
Seen the white cliffs of Dover from the shore

And I kinda fell in love with a Palm Springs trailer park
But those California stars could never steal my heart, 'cause

I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

I'm happy with what I got, 'cause what I got is all I need
Just 'cause it don't cost a lot, don't cost a lot, don't mean it's cheap

'Cause I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home
Yeah, I'll still call my hometown home They're there for your first year, they give you your first beer
When you get your heart broke, they're there for your worst year
Don't get you at all, but your apple don't fall too far from 'em
They own too much wicker and drink too much liquor
You'd wash your hands of them, but blood's always thicker
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

They're there when you're married, divorced and remarried
You fall out of touch, but then someone gets buried
And you're right back together like no time has ever gone by
Can't live with or without 'em; you might talk about 'em
But if someone else does, well, then you'll knock 'em out 'cause
When it's all said and done, they're the only ones that you got

Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

Yeah, family is funny, they'll ask you for money
Even though they know you ain't got no money
They show up at Christmas, get up in your business
They might not be fancy, but family is family

You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em I pick those tomatoes we grew off the vine
They look out the window, just killing time
I reach for the phone just to make sure it's on
And I'm fine
I put on my makeup for no one at all
My heels on the hardwood echo down the hall
And I open the wardrobe, put my face in your clothes
And I'm fine

I try to sleep, I just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

Just like the circus, you always leave town
I can't help but cry when that big top comes down
But I leave the light on and when you get back home
We'll be fine

And I'll try to sleep but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

They always say you don't get to choose
The same old cliché, love chooses you
So, baby, I'll wait just like I always do

And I'll try to sleep, but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

Hmm, hmm There's certain things you're s'posed to know
When you're a girl who grows up in the south
I try to use my common sense
But my foot always ends up in my mouth
And if I had to walk a runway in high heels in front of the whole town
I'd fall down
And my mama cried
When she realized

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me
Life ain't always roses and pantyhose
And...

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't


I ain't pageant material
The only crown is in my glass
They won't be handin' me a sash
And that's okay, cause there's no way
You'll ever see me in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't
Yeah I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there; we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I'm...

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into ""Who's leaving here with who?""
But I just want 'em all to see me come in...

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
No, I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you We're all hoping, we're all hopeless
We're all thorns and we're all roses
We're all looking down our noses at ourselves
We're all flawed and we're all perfect
We're all lost and we're all hurting
And just searching for somebody to love

We're all liars, we're all legends
We're all tens that want elevens
We're all trying to get to heaven, but not today
We're all happy, we're all hatin'
We're all patiently impatient
And just waiting for somebody to love

We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Just thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

We all wrangle with religion
We all talk, but we don't listen
We're all starving for attention, then we run
We're all paper, we're all scissors
We're all fightin' with our mirrors
Scared we'll never find somebody to love

We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

Just tryin' to hold it all together
We all wish our best was better
Just hopin' that forever's really real
We'll miss a dime to grab a nickel
Overcomplicate the simple
We're all little kids just looking for love
Yeah, don't we all just want somebody to love? I think we're thinking too hard
So put on your shoes and get in your car
Put it in drive and point it this way
We don't have to talk, you don't have to stay

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

We've tried being apart
But the truth is we are who we are
We're so much alike, it ain't a good thing
Too dumb to give up, too stubborn to change

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

'Til something better comes along
'Til whatever we have is gone

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is 'til it ain't anymore You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

The winter is so gray, feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

Been missing my roots
I'm getting rid of the flash
Nobody needs a thousand-dollar suit
Just to take out the trash
Ain't gotta be alone to feel lonely
I'm gonna turn off my phone
Start catching up with the old me

It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

Been all wrong
Just wanna feel alright
Tomorrow might come crashing down
But for tonight

It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

I'm gonna let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time Maybe your jacket is a hand-me down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares maybe you're just round

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea

Maybe you're working at a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please

Oh, maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail
Or maybe you failed out of college
But, hey, life goes on
And we've all got the right to be wrong

'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black, some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Why would you wanna be? I don't need a membership to validate
The hard work I've put in and the dues I've paid
Never been too good at just goin' along
I guess I've always kinda been for the underdog

Favors for friends will get you in and get you far
Shouldn't be about who it is you know
But about how good you are

Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club

There's a million ways to dream and that's just fine
Oh, but I ain't losin' any sleep at night
And if I end up goin' down in flames
Well, at least I know I did it my own way
Hey, hey, ey, ey

Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club

Favors for friends will get you in and they'll get you far
But when did it become about who you know
And not about how good you are?

Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
I don't wanna be part of your good ol' boys club Woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies, and the well, it done run dry
You'd light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em, but you just ain't got 'em
Yeah, ain't we always looking for a bluer sky?

But if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

Lemonade keeps turning into lemons
And you wear your heart on a ripped, unraveled sleeve
Been run through the wringer and pushed plum to your limit
You say you're just unlucky, but luck ain't what you need

'Cause if you're ever gonna find a four-leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
And if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
You're gonna have to go to the dance

If you wanna find the honey
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest
You're gonna have to look past the trees

If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
Yeah, it's gotta be a cloudy day
Ooh, and if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo, hoo, hoo Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do, then so what?
So what if I don't wanna, what if I'm just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

Let's put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just let me grab my poncho, I don't care where we go
If we speak the language you know we don't even have to come back

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Die fun
We can't do it over Your heart's as heavy as the stones you throw
Can't see the flowers for the weeds you grow
You blow your bubbles just to watch 'em burst
For you it's always bad to worse

And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

Your neighbor's dirty laundry's cleaner
And the wolf at your door's always meaner
Your sky's still grey when the sun's around
But you can't set sail with your anchor down

And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable
I'm miserable

Can't laugh enough for the both of us
Be half enough for the whole of us
If misery loves company
Then I can't keep you company no more
You
You
You

You... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable We had a girl that came in with a drug overdose the other day. And she got real belligerent. And she bit one of the nurses. (Oh man). And, I mean, she bit (Ohhh)—you could see every tooth (Nooo! Hehe). It took two or three of us to get her off of her. It's a crazy Wednesday

We finally got a flashing light
They put it in last year
And everybody got real happy
When the grocery store got beer
And last time the census men came a-knockin'
We were busting at the seams

Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

Big enough for a ZIP code
A VFW
A good Mexican restaurant
A beauty shop or two
Got a Methodist, a Baptist
And a Church of the Nazarene

Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Yeah, it's too dang small to be mean

Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

You'll end up in the paper
Wreck your family name
What goes around comes back around
By Friday's football game
We only got one sheriff
But we all know how to keep the peace

Aww, and don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

Yeah, somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other Oh my God, it's you
I never thought
I'd see you here

Looks like all is well
Like you're having
A hell of a good time
Me? I'm not gonna lie

Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four-leaf clovers
Yeah, my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you

You can't have your cake
And eat it too
I should have known

'Cause what good is good anyway?
And having it all is just a state of mind
And I, I got no reason to cry

Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four-leaf clovers
Yeah, my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you

Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
I got a big smile on my face
It's the best one I can fake
I'm as happy as half a heart can do
But I miss you It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

And I know that they say, ""Have a happy holiday""
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

And I know that they say, ""Have a happy holiday""
And every year, I swear I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

Seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

And they always say, ""Have a happy holiday""
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
’Cause sleeping alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping
You heard from your friends that I'm doing okay
And you're thinking that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

Yeah, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate
Going home alone
'Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

Hmm
Yeah, keep it to yourself
Hmm Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer
And Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college

I'm just flicking ash into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah (Hey yeah)
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

Dandelion
A million little wishes blow
Across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinking it could change my world

Dandelion
A million little wishes blow
Across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses out
Across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion
Dandelion Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
I walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you’re too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb? Are you blind?
'Cause it’s a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning the knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Yeah–

You screwed everybody over in this town
There ain't nothing between you and the cold, hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
And when you finally get to the top
Mmm, step off

Sticks and stones
May build a throne
But you'll be up there all alone
So step off
Yeah, yeah, step off

And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Mmm, just step off
Step off Ah-one, two, three, four

Who needs a house up on a hill
When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow?
You don't ever have to mow the yard
Just hang a map and throw a dart
And pray to God the engine starts and go

Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

Parking lots and county lines
And counting mile marker signs
Where the buffalo and antelope all roam
Greetings from Niagara Falls
One more postcard for the wall
Off in our own sweet home away from home

Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

In Washington, in Idaho
In Oregon, and away we go
To Tennessee and Arkansas
No, we won't stop 'til we've seen 'em all
'Til we've seen 'em all

So what else could you ask for?
You don't even need a passport
To see the whole world from our living room
So come on hitch your wagon
To the happiness I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home Look around you, look down the bar from you
At the faces that you see
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
These are your friends, but are they real friends?
Do they love you as much as me?
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
You seem in such a hurry
To lead this kind of life
And you cause so many things
Misery

So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-be's
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

Please don't let my tears persuade you
I'd hoped I wouldn't cry
Although lately teardrops seem a part of me

So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-be's
Are you sure that this is where you want to be? You say that you’re watching the birds out the window
Well I’ve got a bird you can watch
You ain’t gotta act like you’re borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
And what’s it to you if it’s Wednesday at noon
And I’ve traded my iced tea for scotch

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

You ain’t gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear’s on the line
They ain’t mine
I ain’t gonna ask who's been mowing your grass
So you ain’t gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your mini blinds

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

Don’t ask me if I go to church
I won’t ask if your husband is still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

You nosey bitch
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you girl, sippin' on champagne

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl
Sit by the fire, we've been moving too fast Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back
Was I the one who drifted off?
Did I take advantage of good love?
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love without the trust?
Does anybody wanna

Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

Something steady, something good
It's probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid, it's getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know, it's hard to read
So I'll just keep moving, hoping someone out there's gonna

Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

S.O.S. is out of hand
Just holding out for a love again
I'm sending signals, find me fast
I know, I know there's gotta be somebody who can

Put me back, put me back
On the map
'Cause I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

On the map
On the map Plays you like a fiddle, shakes you like a rattle
Takes away your gun and sends you into battle
Huffs and it puffs 'til it blows your house down
And you don't know your heart from a hole in the ground

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

Girl meets boy and, boy, he's a looker
Can't separate the salt from the sugar
There's nothing in your pockets, there's footprints on your face
You can't tell anymore if you're the rabbit or the snake (Hey!)

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

I drink to feel
I smoke to breathe
Just look what love
Has done to me

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking so damn
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a doll, no dinky tinker toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me, too

Mom says the hippo would eat me up
But then, my teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
There's lots of room for him in our two car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there
And give him his massage

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses-es
I only like hippopotamuses-es
And hippopotamuses like me, too I'm gonna wrap my presents up in red bandanas
And leave some special cookies out for Santa
Throw my troubles to the wind 'til we're back on the road again
Here's to finding your own little piece on Earth

And I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
If you're in Luckenbach or Waikiki
Yeah, I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
And may we all stay higher than the angel on top of the tree

Don't get caught up in the hustle and the bustle
This time of year ain't supposed to be so stressful
Here's to easily silent nights and finding your own paradise
'Cause whatever family, might call your own

And I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
And may it be a lot more green than blue

And may we all stay higher than the angel on top of the tree

Happy Holidays from Willie and me
And Merry Christmas, everybody I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, too late, oh, oh

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
That's nothing new, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry, like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said ""Oh she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again
I've got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said ""Oh she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then

My best friend Leslie said ""Oh she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space
And when you're out there, without a care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
Oh, you think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, yeah, it looked like fun
So it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Well, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
Mmm

Lana Del Rey
Kacey Musgraves Got a letter just this morning, it was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written, offering me this better job
Better job and higher wages, expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally, and I can't quit, I'm a star
I come on the TV grinning, wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddy show and I'm a hero of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Yodelee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I got a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery and my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star, that's what I are

In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun
And snap!
The job's a game!
(sung)
And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark, a spree, It's very clear to see

That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way

A robin feathering his nest
Has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He's got a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along

And a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
(spoken)
All right, boys!
Uh huh

(sung)
The honey bees that fetch the nectar
From the flowers to the comb
They never tire of buzzing to and fro
Yeah, 'cause they take a little nip
From every flower that they sip
And hence
(And hence)
They find
(They find)
Their task is not a grind
(spoken)
Can't ya'll play it any faster?

Sure, yeah!
One, two, three!
(sung)

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In the most delightful way
(spoken)
Pick it up, boys!

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
(spoken)
Even faster!
(sung)
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
Medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
Oh, in a most delightful way! When the bells all ring and the horns all blow
And the couples that we know are finally kissing
Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?
Maybe it's much too early in the game
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly 12 o'clock midnight
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve
Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve? Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

These are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel

And these are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true

There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe (Yeah, oh)
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
I've been good, but I can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late

Want a plane that loops the loop
And I still want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say

There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
So, you draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Nine o'clock mornings, and five o'clock evenings
I'd liven up the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham on my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do you no good
So I laid my chair, close my eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
'Cause Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
And everyone else is in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains

At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
'Cause everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Woo!

Love is a liar
Makes you think you're on a high
When you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

Candy coated promises they're always tryin' to sell ya
But there's a whole lot of stories that the books never tell ya
And you're cryin' and sleepin' in your clothes...

'Cause love is a liar
Makes you think you're on a high

If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

There's a reason for the pain is what they say if you ask

Honestly, I have nothing ready for Christmas
I didn't know you were coming
Hey, don't sweat it, I'm just here to sing a song

We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Hoo hoo

Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you, girl, sippin' on champagne

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, hmm

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Hmm
Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl, yeah
Come sit by the fire (Yeah, yeah) It feels like we're supposed to be happy during the holidays
But, sometimes they just make you really sad
So, I wrote this song for anybody that might be feeling a little bit lonely

It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

And I know that they say, ""Have a happy holiday""
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

And I know that they say, ""Have a happy holiday""
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

It seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

And they always say, ""Have a happy holiday""
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always Well, here's one for all the little kids
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very shiny nose
Well, and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glowed
(Like a light bulb)
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
Oh, they never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Oh, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history

Well, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history
Yeah, you'll go down, go down in history I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
Take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
You drove me outta' my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
Instead of wastin' my time trying to make you feel good
I'm gonna see what kinda' life is up in front of my hood
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
I can drive away far and I can run pretty fast
The plan for my future's puttin' you in my past
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
So don't bother to call and don't bother to write
Cuz' freedom's just ahead in the beam of my lights
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
You can take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you One, two, three, four
Hey, everybody
Thank you so much for watching the show
This has been so much fun
Have a wonderful new year, happy holidays

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine, yeah

I don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
They'll walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love, yeah

Just need your love
Just need your love Hey, Fred. What are you doing in here?
Hey, Kacey, I’m just (Hey) catching up on some reading. It’s so peaceful
Yeah, it really is. What are you reading?
It’s a book of Christmas carols
Cool. You got any faves?
I kinda do. This one
Oh, Silent Night
Yeah, it’s my favorite. I think it might be one of the most beautiful songs ever written
You know, we should just sing it together right now
Kacey, I can’t think of anything more wonderful

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
‘Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so—

Sir. Sir, sir. Sir. Mister, what are you doing?
Well, I’m just putting this painting up
Well, do you have to do it right now?
Well, I mean, it’s, it’s meant for this, uh, song thing you’re doing
Okay, well, I appreciate that, but don’t you think you should’ve done it before we started singing?
Well, yeah, I’m sorry. I was on another job. It ran over. (Okay, but)
Okay? So I’ve got to do it now. Alright?
Well, sir. Sir, sir. Stop! Stop it, please. We are in the middle of singing
It’s alright. I’m nearly done
So, sorry
It’s okay
I’m really sorry
It’s alright
One moment
He’s putting up the painting. Yeah
There, we, go!
Great. Awesome
Great. (Done!)
(Thank you) Please leave. Off, off you go
No problem. I’ve got plenty more to be getting through on my list anyway. Bye bye
Thank you
So, sorry
See you later, Kacey. Big fan of your work
Thanks
Do you know that guy?
Never seen him
Well, where were we, um
Um, Silent Night
Yes
Gorgeous song. Love it
Beautiful song
‘Kay
Here we go


Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
‘Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so te—

Hey! Hey! What the heck? What? Hey! Stop! Stop! What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s just that fixing this light is next on my list
I asked you to leave, okay? Are you kidding me? Can you choose another room to do this work in? (Yeah)
Yeah, no, fair point. Sorry ‘bout that. I’ll see what I can do. You carry on
Ye-ye-yes (Don’t mind me)
Kacey
Incredible
What? Can we just do it one more time, please?
Let’s do it one more time. (Okay) The most beautiful song ever written


Silent night, holy night—

Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
I’m sorry, i-i-it just turns out that all my jobs on my list are in this room
I-I-I, I’ll tell you what, I’ll try and do it quietly
Stop, stop. (It’s a— you—) Stop. Stop it!
You’re, you’re not even doing it more quietly. It’s just a little bit slower
It’s kinda, it’s worse
I want you to go, okay? Please go
Kacey, do you want me to go?
Yeah, I think, I think you should leave
See you later, Kacey
Bye
Alright, wonderful
Um, do you have time for just one more?
Should we do it?
Yeah. (Okay)
Is that cool?
I would love to
Alright, here we go
Yeah, okay
Okay
Here we go

Silent night, holy night
All is calm—

You know what? I think it’s quite enough for this song. We’ve done it, right?
Forget it, yeah
Great song
Thanks
Sir? Maybe I won't find
Any old love letters
Maybe I won't wish
You'd come down the hall
Maybe my picture frames
Won't look so empty
I have to take 'em down
Off the wall
Maybe the rain will come
After I'm sleeping
Maybe in my dreams
I won't feel this pain
Maybe I'll find my way
Back to morning
Without hearing whispers of your name
Maybe I'll find some things
To keep my mind busy
Maybe I'll sell this car
Sell this ol' ring
Maybe that'll be enough
To finally convince me
That you're not here
And I really don't have anything
Maybe I'll try
Try to get out some
Maybe our favorite places
Will still feel the same
Maybe when I sit alone
At our old table
I won't hear whispers of your name
I won't hear whispers of your name Dance around
A little flame
Candles burn out your name
Empty chair
Stands so bold
Your not here anymore
I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again
I live in pieces
Everyday makes a hole an it
Tears away at my tired soul
I don't sleep (I can't sleep without you)
And I can't cry (I'm always crying)
Empty house full glass of wine
I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again
I live in pieces
Dance around a little flame
Candles burn out your name I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you
I've got twenty bucks and this road ahead
Plenty of time to clear my head
And I know, I don't need you
Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time
I'm staring down at these white lines
They're taking me further and passing the time
I know, I don't need you
You had one last chance and you threw it away
It don't matter what I've gotta say
And I know, I don't need you
Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
I know more than I did back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time
Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
I'm gonna toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken
I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you

. When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

Well, the skies have finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
And you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
But, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
Yeah, you'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around

'Cause the skies have finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
But, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

Hmm
It'll all be alright

It's gonna be alright, everybody
Stay strong and stay inside I know you stole my panties cause I have the matching bra
And  night she saw you out with my favorite dress on
She said you were dancing in my black snakeskin flats
Looking like a stripper and you didn't even match

You want a five-finger discount, but nothing in life is free
You better hope that karma isn't a bigger bitch than me
I'll give you a five-finger discount  twenty percent off I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, I just know I couldn’t stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
(Hey, hey)

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart Standby
Who's ready for a great show?
Let me hear you scream! (10)
Camilla Cabello's gonna be here! (Nine, eight)
Kendall Jenner, everybody! (Seven, six)
Zooey Deschanel is here! (Five, four)
Fred Armisen's here! (Three, facing camera two, two)
Lana Del Rey! (One)
And the star of the show, Kacey Musgraves! (Three, two, one, action) And so, Kacey had an emo moment in her bedroom
Because sometimes, just sometimes
A great singing career, a bunch of GRAMMYs
And this over the top bathroom just aren't enough
Yet as Christmas Eve rolled on, would Kacey get ready in time?
Would she sing another holiday ditty that's overplayed in cafes and shopping mall restrooms?
And most importantly, would more celebrity friends continue to make surprise appearances that everyone sees coming but Kacey?
I don't know
Dan (Yes?)
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just, um, I'm just freshening up in your bathroom
Look, if you could be just a little less negative when you narrate
That would be, that'd be nice
Wow, okay, um
It's Christmas, you know? We need Christmas cheer (Right)
Lots of cheer (Okay)
You know, happy...
You know, you're funny and that's kinda why we hired you, so, you know
So cheer then?
Cheer
For a corporate holiday in this political climate
Okay, sure, if cheer is what you want, Kacey
Then cheer is what you'll get
Thank you
Thank you
Right
Thank you so much, bye
Welcome back, friends!
Where was I? Oh right
It's Christmas Eve and Kacey still couldn't find her Nana's Christmas ornament Hi Kacey, what's going on? Everything okay?
I guess
What's the matter?
I thought things were finally coming together
I'm just missing my family
Mm
Uh, it's not Christmas without going to Nana's house
Well, maybe this will make things better
I wanted to clear the air between us, so
I made you some Christmas cookies
You made these?
Yes
Processed in a factory
That's what I call my kitchen
Expired in 2017
I was looking out for your health
There's a price tag right-
Yeah, I would love to keep chatting about this but
I think there's more show to do
Yeah
And it could be time for another song

Troye!
There you are Kacey
Thanks for coming!
Of course!
I got a brand new song, you wanna sing it?
Yeah
Alright At Christmas, I no more desire a rose than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows
That, of course, is William Shakespeare and I have absolutely no idea what it means
But that isn't the story we're here to tell
On this arguably festive winter's evening
Kacey Musgraves is getting ready for her favorite holiday
No, not President's Day, Christmas
Unfortunately, she and her band only just got home from tour
Which didn't leave her much time to prepare
Get an assistant, Kacey, am I right?
It is Christmas Eve, after all

Guys, has anybody seen that star ornament that my nana got me?
It goes on top of the tree
A star ornament?
Yeah (What's it look like?)
A star
I don't know
Okay, well if you see it, let me know
Because I gotta get ready for Christmas

The band got concerned hearing this
For it was already Christmas Eve
A day being famous for being one day before Christmas
And, clearly, Kacey had a lot to do

Alright, yeah, I know I have a lot to do, but, I mean, is anyone gonna help me?
I made that banner
Oh, ""Merry Christma—""
The printer ran out of ink
Who's that?
That might be one of your guests
Okay, but it's Christmas Eve and I thought people were gonna be coming tomorrow
Somebody called, said they couldn't do tomorrow, so I invited 'em
And did you let me know this?
I literally just did?
Alright, I'm coming I got my sights set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will
Never be tamed
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowing
When something is right
I feel like I must have known you
In another life
'cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said ""Oh she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can rest till then (a-whoa a-whoa)
Now I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim

(a-whoa a-whoa)
Now I can't wait to see you again Well, that was sweet
Almost as sweet as these cookies
After Kacey finished wrapping gifts, it was time for another duet
And great duets can't happen without great friends.​

I really, really appreciate you making the time to come here.​
Of course! I'm so happy to be here.​
Well, I would love to sing one of my favorite holiday classics with you.​
Yes! Let's do it.​
'Kay.​ Oh, wow, an unexpected duet!
Now with Leon out of her festively coiffed hair
Kacey and the band began to focus on a game plan

Alright, what am I going to need for Christmas tomorrow, besides alcohol?
Decorations? You don't really have any of those
What else?
Presents? Family?
Snacks, man
Yeah, snacks, where are all the snacks?
I have no snacks
You know, you didn’t have to host Christmas this year
I know, but I love Christmas
I mean, yeah, the planning is stressful
But, you know, when you get to sing or hear a Christmas song that you really love
There's no better feeling

And so, even though Kacey had made virtually no progress with her Christmas preparations
She did, somehow, manage to find time for another song Well the bedroom lights finally went out for the night
The ringing in my ears from all your bitchin' has finally gone quiet
Can't watch TV for five minutes without the changing the channel again
I'm sick and tired of fightin' over Springer and Rosanne

I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you

You drank all the Keystone and you smoked my last cigarette
Went on a shopping spree at the dollar store, put us a little bit further in debt
The sun came up this morning and I thought about how things have been
Baby, take a good look at this face 'cause you ain't gonna see it again

'Cause I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you
I want nothing more than less of you I need some real air to breathe
I hate the way they look at me
A part of me is so far away
And I miss that Southern sky
Love took me where you wanted to go
Down a real bad stretch of road
You leave me here most every night
I can't stand this cold
You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas
Give me a one-light town
Put me in a front porch swing
Give me a Gold Star in that Texas bar
That's the way it should be
Lord knows how you're gonna end
And I won't let you pull me in
I've spent too long away from what I know

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas
I'm going back to Texas
Take me home
I'm going home, I'm going home Hey
You guys really haven't seen that star topper for the tree?
No. Have you checked the top of the tree?
Not helpful dude
Who could that be?
I don't think I even know any more duets

Nana!
I thought you might like this
Where'd you find that?
You left it at my house last Christmas
Come here, come here, I missed you
I can't believe, what are you doing? Oh my-
Come here
I have so much to show you
I've been filming this amazing thing
You came all the way here from Texas?
I did
Yeah? How was the drive?

And so, as Kacey hugged her nana
Our age old tale of Christmas seemed to be coming to a close

I love you
I love you more
Christmas is not Christmas without you, so thanks for coming
Thank you

The whole world is very, very sweet
So sweet, but this narrator has to leave

Whoa, uh, where are you going?
Sorry, I, I gotta run
Like, right now?
Yeah, um, seeing you with our nana
My nana
Sure
It just reminded me that
This isn't just some big corporate holiday, it's
It's also about being with the people you love
And getting gifts
So, I booked a flight home
Wow, uh, that's, that's really sweet
Thank you so much
Little unprofessional
Wow
But I get it
And the Christian half of me finally gets what this holiday's all about
You did it Kacey, look around
You made Christmas happen
Merry Christmas, Dan
Merry Christmas, Kacey
Also, taking a gift
Beautiful home
Love what you did with it As the Christmas hour drew closer and closer
Kacey was feeling less and less relaxed
For it was too late to buy gifts for her band
Ugh, how did I forget to buy gifts for all the band?
You see, she had all year
I had all year
But the truth is, she just didn't know what to get those guys
I didn't know what to get those guys
And she'd been so busy
I've been so busy
Like super, super busy
They get it (Mmkay)
And to make matters worse, she'd just said all this out loud in front of the band themselves
Don't worry about it Kacey, we don't really need gifts
We do get paid and all
No, you guys do so much for me
I'm gonna figure this out, I promise
You know what? Maybe this'll help I don't wanna love you, but I do
Baby, there’s just something about you
My mind screaming something, my heart just can't do
I don't wanna love you, but I do
Yeah, I don’t wanna feel this, but I am
I wish I could say I didn't give a damn
I'd love to shut their feelings down, it fell out of hand
I don't wanna feel this by 
I can't believe I hung around long enough for love to get a hold
I've always been the kind, to always know the perfect time to go
I don't wanna leave you, but I will
Though I know it's gonna hurt like hell
Lord knows I know better than doing this to myself
I don’t wanna leave you, but I will
I don’t wanna love you, but I do
Baby, there's just something about you
My mind screaming something, my heart just can’t do
I don't wanna love you, but I do
And my heart is saying one thing, but my mind knows the truth
I don't wanna love you, but I do
I don't wanna love you, but I do Peanut butter jelly sandwiches are made with love
In the shape of a heart
Driving twelve hours just to kiss my face
In my arms on , yeah

This must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, hey
When they talk about love

Messed up hair and I don't mind
""Come here, baby"" kisses are my favorite kind
Don't forget to call when you wake up
A little extra sugar in my coffee cup

Yeah, this must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, hey
When they talk about love

They must be talking about the way we look at me
Oh-oh
I bet that they were wishing they were you and me
Yeah

This must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, hey
When they talk about
This must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, yeah

When they talk about love
When they talk about love
I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, yeah, hey
When they talk about love

Messed up hair and I don't mind
""Come here, baby"" kisses are my favorite kind
Don't forget to call when you wake up
A little extra sugar in my coffee cup They make me clean up my room
And put away my toys
When company comes
I can't make any noise, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
They say I must take a bath
But I've had one bedore
I'm just so upset
I can't take anymore
Don't they remember
All the heartache so deep
When somebody tells you
Its time now for sleep, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
Please let me stay up too late
I don't wanna go to bed
I'm not even tired
I just wanna play instead
Won't somebody listen
To these feelings of mine
Can't anyone hear me
Or do I have to whine
I don't want to clean up my room
Don't wanna put away my toys
When company comes
I prefer making noise
I don't want any bath
Oh, and I never did
It's a difficult world
When your only a kid
Thank you, Goodnight I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been admired by, it's such a fine light
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm growing old A two-step soothes my broken heart
A fiddle kills the pain
The neon lights, they ease my mind
'Til you come back again
You're gonna tell me that you love me
And make promises you'll break
But until then I'll sit alone
With a honkytonk heartache
Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left
Well that bottle of good whiskey
Couldn't drive you from my head
And it can't erase the memory
Of her there in our bed
Comin' home without you is just
More than I can take
I'm gonna wash down your memory
With this honkytonk heartache
Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left
I'm gonna feel this in the morning, this honkytonk heartache When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

Well the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Darlin', I'm just tryna tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
Tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Darlin', I'm just tryna tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella
Darlin', I'm just tryna tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
You ain't ever gonna come down

Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
You ain't ever gonna come down

Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
You ain’t ever gonna come down Here I go breakin' my own heart again
I didn't know that things could get this outta hand
If I called home right now, I'd guarantee
I'd get my share of advice that I don't want, but I might need

'Cause Daddy says at dinner, ""Ain't you to meet a man""
And Mama says, ""It don't hurt to find a good one if you can""
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
And they can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

I got dreams and I don't really wanna put 'em down
That boy can't see past the edges of this town
And I'm not hangin' around

'Cause Daddy says at dinner, ""Ain't you to meet a man""
And Mama says, ""It don't hurt to find a good one if you can""
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

I know the truth is that they're usually right, but
I gotta point this steering wheel my own way
Tonight 'cause

Daddy says at dinner, ""Ain't you to meet a man""
And Mama says, ""It don't hurt to find a good one if you can""
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop my reachin' for all the livin' I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road
I got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah Ayo, We takin off on my high horse , cop a jet with my fly girl
Racing with queen kacey to our Kawaii force
H-h-h-high horse , thicker than a candy bar It was 4 AM, I couldn't sleep
So I did my hair and I fixed a drink
Sat on the porch with my guitar
Sang about how you broke my heart
Singing ""la la la la la la""
And I went and tore your pictures up
Built a fire in my bathtub
Painted my toes while I watched them burn
Then put out the flames with your T-shirt

If you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say, ""I love you, baby""
That's what I call crazy

If the neighbor looked through my window pane
He'd say, ""She's finally gone insane""
All the things I do 'round this old house
Like cussing your name, screaming out loud
My bedroom wall's got a hole in it now

But if you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say, ""I love you, baby""
That's what I call crazy (Crazy)

I've been seeing red
Since you said goodbye
I might break a thing or two sometimes

But if you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say, ""I love you, baby""
That's what I call crazy
That's what I call crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
That's what I call crazy, oh
That's what I call crazy
Singing la la la la la la I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

Here lies the girl whosе only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go beforе I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie 'em in a knot like a hangman's noose
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I see you with someone else

And let the stone say:

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
There'll be a stone right next to mine
And we'll be together 'til the end of time

I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead

         Who’d-a guessed that Aquanet
Could start a fire with a single cigarette
She wasn’t drunk, she wasn’t stoned
Just sick and tired of wonderin’ when he was coming home
She drove around, she found his car
They heard the boom from in the bar
He called the cops, she called his bluff
They hauled her off in high heels and handcuffs

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till they’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive 'em, no they weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men

He told his friends she was depressed
Borderline bipolar, a bitch with PMS
He cheats and lies, then plays the victim
He don’t know why they always seem to pick him

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till they’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive 'em, no they weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men

Some take a pistol, some take an axe
Boy, if you build a fire, you better bet she’s got a match
Might be the teacher just down the street
The hairdresser or the housewife or that waitress that’s so sweet
And you won’t see it when you meet her
So be careful how you treat her
She might look just like me

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
We keep our crazy hidden till we’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive us, no we weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men
No, crazy women are made by crazy men Eu gosto de onde isso está indo
E você também
Nós quase nunca nos entendemos
Mas nós vamos

Eu posso te mostrar força, posso lutar por você
Posso tentar mover montanhas se você quiser

Porque, querido, não sou a Mulher Maravilha
Eu não sei laçar o seu amor por mim
Você não sabe que sou apenas humana?
E se eu te decepcionar, não foi minha intenção
Tudo o que eu preciso é de um lugar no qual pousar
Eu não preciso de um Super Homem para me conquistar
Porque, querido, não sou a Mulher Maravilha

Aposto que todo aquele ouro fica pesado
Sobrecarregando ela
Imagino se não é assustador
Sempre tentar não se machucar

Eu sei como é, não é fácil
Há uma razão pela qual só se vê em filmes

Porque, querido, não sou a Mulher Maravilha
Eu não sei laçar o verdade de você
Você não sabe que sou apenas humana?
E se eu te decepcionar, não foi minha intenção
Tudo o que eu preciso é de um lugar no qual pousar
Eu não preciso de um Super Homem para me conquistar

Você não sabe voar
Tudo bem, nem eu

Eu sei que não sou a Mulher Maravilha
Eu não sei como laçar o seu amor por mim
Você não sabe que sou só humana?
E se eu te decepcionar, não foi a intenção
Tuo o que eu precisp é de um lugar no qual pousar
Eu não preciso de um Super Homem para me conquistar
Porque, querido, não sou a Mulher Maravilha
É, eu sei que não sou a Mulher Maravilha"
