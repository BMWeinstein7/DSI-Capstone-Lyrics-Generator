The night is ours
Spring in the wood of skies
We head to the heath with our tent, where the berries grow
Take me, dear friend to the mirth of yesterdays
Where our creek runs free and the birch will blow
Light in the mountains
Scent from our dearest fountains
The wind is counting your hair in the light aglow
The dew comes forth
Our valley is swept with peace
Our dreams come true, who sleep in the wood of skies
On the berry hearth, the last touch of sunlight dies
And the calm is deep where the quiet waters flow
Light in the mountains
Scent from our dearest fountains
The wind is counting your hair in the light aglow
Light in the mountains
Scent from our dearest fountains
The wind is counting your hair in the light aglow
The wind is counting your hair It weighs heavier on one's heart
I could tell right from the start that sweet ones are hard to come across
Well there is more than meets the eye
Heart like yours is rare to find
Someone else's gain will be my loss
Woah, woah, oh oh
Oh woah, woah
Woah woah oh
Hey hey

Well little things that make you smile
Dancing barefoot in the dark
If only I had strength to change your mind
Oh for what you need
You will not see
Choose your words before you speak
Can you see that all you've got is time?

Woah now
Save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Oh darling save yourself for someone else
Yeah, save yourself
Oh darling save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself from someone else
Woah
Don't give in to their feelings
Don't give in darkness and faith
You should be safe, yeah, with someone else

Tell your secrets to the night
You do yours and I do mine
So we won't have to keep them all inside
Oh, for one so pure
Count these off
Let your feelings take control
Hold on to the world that he's begging for

Woah now
Save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Go on and save yourself for someone else
Yes darling save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Go on and save yourself for someone else
Woah are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Woah aren't you going to take me?
Yeah are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Woah what's it going to take?
Yeah, are you going to break?

Are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Are you going to break? (For an English translation of the song, view the page here on Genius!)
Kvöldið er okkar og vor um Vaglaskóg
Við skulum tjalda í grænum berjamó

One thinking of one another
Never thinking just for one second
She would take a different attraction
 X2
We don't want that

We don't want that
Oh no

I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
Can't go on without you, yeah

So, so you better hush and walk away

I can't go on without you, oh
Oh without you lord, without you
Without you babe
Oh lord
You All the pretty girls like Samuel
Oh he really doesn't share
Though it's more than he can handle
Life is anything but fair, life is anything but fair

Just as soon as they turn older
He'll come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
All the hidden love beneath

So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down

All alone, alone again
No one lends a helping hand
I have waited, I have waited
Takes a toll, one's foolish pride
How long before I see the light
I have waited, I have waited for you to lay me down

Sail on by, sail on by for now
They play naked in the water
You know it's hard, heaven knows I've tried
But it just keeps getting harder

So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay
Oh won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, oh won't you lay me down
Oh Won't you lay me, say won't you lay me down

Yeah I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you

For you to lay me
Won't you lay me down The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free
Oh, the devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free

I went down, deep Texas, Mississippi state
Hoping things might go my way
For every hard-earned dollar I make
There stands a white man just to take it away
Some might say I talk loud, see if I care
Unlike them, don't walk away from my fear
I've busted bones, broken stones, looked the devil in the eye
I hope he's going to break these chains, oh yeah

The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free
The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free
(Yeah, set me free)

Another hard day, no water, no rest
I saw my chance, so I got him at last
I took his six-shooter, put two in his chest
He'll never say a word no more
Oh, he'll never say a word no more
The devil got him good for sure

Ain't got no place to call a home
Only chains and broken bones
Ain't got no place to call a home
So come on Lord, won't you take me now?
Ain't got no place to call a home
Only chains and broken bones
Ain't got no place to call a home
So come on Lord, what you waiting for?

Oh, the devil's going to make me a free man

Wheels take me, I can't stay

But you don't have the courage
To give yourself the gun
Never mind, mind
Never mind, ohhh
Never mind, mind
Better mind
Oh lord, you are a sucker
'Cause your head is up in the sky
I said your head is up in the sky
All, all I need
Quietly she sings
Bright as the moonlight
I'm bound to change the game

         Way before I met you
It didn't feel right
You were the one
Going on with our lives
We talk of obsession
Yeah that's what I feel with it
It's you that I want
And I'm sold for real
But I know you would like me to know
When I'm fucking finished up with you
Baby don't you worry, 
Baby don't you worry, 
Talking over 
Such an easy 
Isn't this sweet?
A new kind of story
Yeah that's what you got to give
Chance of 
The shivers' within
Now I know you would like me to know
When I'm fucking finished up with you
Baby don't you worry, 
Baby don't you worry, 
Would you come down
When you're smilin'
Broken inside
Those emotions
You had to hide them
Made up your mind
Would you come down
When you're smilin'
Broken inside (woah)
All those emotions
You had to hide them
You made up my mind
'Cause you know you're haunting me
For all the things I've seen
Tonight don't need no bag of bones
Don't wake before I'm done
Yeah don't wake before 



Baby don't please
Blame it on me
Baby no more
While we don't show
Baby don't mind
While she don't find
Baby don't please
Blame it on me
Baby don't mind
While she don't find
Baby don't go
While we don't show
Baby don't mind
That's why you won't die
Baby don't leave
'Cause your dreams are haunting me
For all the things I've seen
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Don't wake before I'm done
It's gonna let your mind be your 
 Yeah 
(Woah)

         Oh dear John please don't leave me tonight
I don't know what I'm gonna do without you by my side
Well I drank to much booze, to forget this old blues but
Waking up without you I can hardly breathe
Oh dear John please don't leave me tonight
You stole my heart like a thief in the daylight
Well my friends keep saying to me, you were so bad for me
But waking up without you I can hardly breathe oh no
Waking up without you I can hardly breathe oh yeah
Waking up without you I can hardly breathe
Well my friends keep saying to me, you were so bad for me
But waking up without you I can hardly breathe oh no
Waking up without you I can hardly breathe oh yeah
Waking up without you I can hardly breathe oh Lord
Oh dear John don't leave me tonight
Ooo I don't know, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without you by my side

It didn't feel right
You were the one
Going on with our lives
We talk of obsession
Yeah, that's what I feel of it
It's you that I want
And i'm sold for real
But I know you like me too
When I'm fucking finished off with you
Baby, dont you worry, about who I am
Baby, dont you worry, about who I am
Talking of wild love
Need to be free
Such an easy talker
Isn't this sweet
A new kind of story
Yeah, that's what you got to give
Chance of my cold love
The shivers within
Now I know you like me too
When i'm fucking finished off with you
Baby, dont you worry, about who I am
Baby, dont you worry, about who I am

Would you come down
When you're smiling
Broken inside
Those emotions
You have to hide them
Made up your mind
Would you come down
When you're smiling
Broken inside
Those emotions
You have to hide them
You made up your mind
But do you know you're haunting me
For all the things i've seen
Tonight don't need no bag of bones
