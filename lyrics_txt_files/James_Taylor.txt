"Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running oh yeah baby
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah yeah
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
Should begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud now
Soon I be knocking
Upon your door
You just call out my name
And you know where ever I am
I'll come running oh yes I will
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall yeah
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah yeah yeah
Hey, ain't it good to know
That you've got a friend?
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you
And desert you
Well, they'll take your soul
If you let them
Oh yeah, but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again, oh baby don't you know 'bout
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
Ain't now all you got to do is call
Lord, I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend
You've got a friend, yes
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Oh yeah yeah
You've got a friend In my mind, I'm going to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm going to Carolina in my mind

Karen, she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I?
I'm going to Carolina in my mind

There ain't no doubt in no one's mind
That love's the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey, baby, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I?
I'm going to Carolina in my mind

In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind

Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway call
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
The signs that might be omens say I'm going, going
Gone to Carolina in my mind

Now where holy host of others standing around me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it looks like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me
If its up and gone to Carolina in my mind

In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Gotta make it back home again soon
Gotta get back to Carolina soon
Gotta make it back to my home again soon
Oh no gotta get back to Carolina soon
Carolina yeah
Gotta get back home soon
I can't travel no more, baby
Gotta get back home again
Gotta get back to Carolina soon
Gotta get back on home again soon
Gotta get back home There is a young cowboy he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises, he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the dogies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams?
And rockabye sweet baby James
Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Now the Berkshires seemed dreamlike
On account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go, whoa
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it, if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me
So goodnight all you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams?
And rockabye sweet baby James Whenever I see your smiling face
I have to smile myself
Because I love you (Yes, I do)
And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby (I don't know)

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It will grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

I thought I was in love
A couple of times before
With the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you
And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Sent down to break my heart

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It will grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that, tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today, no no darling
No no, darling, no no, yeah yeah
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today You can play the game and you can act out the part
Though you know it wasn't written for you
But tell me, how can you stand there with your broken heart?
Ashamed of playing the fool
One thing can lead to another
It doesn't take any sacrifice
Oh, father and mother, sister and brother
If it feels nice, don't think twice yes
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna work out fine if you only will
(Do as I say, yes)
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do with your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody the way that you feel
You can feel it beginning to ease
I think it's true what they say about the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease
Better to shower the people you love with love
Yes and show them the way that you feel
I know things are gonna be just fine if you only will
(What I like to do to you)
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
Whoa (Shower the people you love with love)
Yeah whoa yeah (Show them the way that you feel)
You'll feel better right away (Shower the people you love with love)
Don't take much to do (Show them the way that you feel)
Sell you pride (Shower the people you love with love)
I say (Show them the way that you feel)
They say in every life (Shower the people you love with love)
They say the rain must fall (Show them the way that you feel)
Just like pouring rain (Shower the people you love with love)
Make it rain (Show them the way that you feel)
Make it rain (Shower the people you love with love)
Love, love, love is sunshine oh (Show them the way that you feel)
Oh yes (Shower the people you love with love)
Make it rain (Show them the way that you feel)
Love, love, love is sunshine yeah (Shower the people you love with love)
All right (Show them the way that you feel)
Everybody, everybody (Shower the people you love with love)
Everybody, everybody (Show them the way that you feel) Hey girls, gather round
Listen to what I'm putting down
Hey baby, I'm your handy man
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can
If your broken heart should need repair
Then I am the man to see
I whisper sweet things
You tell all your friends
They'll come running to me
Here is the main thing that I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts
I know that I truly can
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Oh now, they'll come running to me
Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, baby
I'm your handy man
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Come
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Come
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's me
(Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come)
I'm your handy man
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's me
(Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come)
I'm your handy man
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Way down here, you need a reason to move
Feel a fool, running your stateside games
Lose your load, leave your mind behind Baby James
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so simple I just got to go
The sun's so hot I forgot to go home
Guess I'll have to go now
Americano got the sleepy eye
But his body's still shaking like a live wire
Sleepy Señorita with the eyes on fire
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
The moon's so bright like to light up the night
Make everything all right
Baby's hungry and the money's all gone
The folks back home don't want to talk on the phone
She gets a long letter, sends back a postcard
Times are hard
Oh, down in Mexico
I never really been so I don't really know
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go
Oh, Mexico
I never really been but I'd sure like to go
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go now

Talking 'bout in Mexico (Mexico)
In a honky tonk down in Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico Even the old folks never knew
Why they call it like they do
I was wondering since the age of two
Down on Copperline
Copper head, copper beech
Copper kettles sitting side by each
Copper coil, cup o'Georgia peach
Down on Copperline
Half a mile down to Morgan Creek
Leaning heavy on the end of the week
Hercules and a hog-nosed snake
Down on Copperline
We were down on Copperline
One Summer night on the Copperline
Slip away past supper time
Wood smoke and moonshine
Down on Copperline
One time I saw my Daddy dance
Watched him moving like a man in a trance
He brought it back from the war in France
Down onto Copperline
Branch water and tomato wine
Creosote and turpentine
Sour mash and new moon shine
Down on Copperline
Down on Copperline
First kiss ever I took
Like a page from a romance book
The sky opened and the earth shook
Down on Copperline
Down on Copperline yeah
Took a fall from a windy height
I only knew how to hold on tight
And pray for love enough to last all night
Down on Copperline
Day breaks and the boys wakes up
And the dog barks and the birds sings
And the sap rises and the angels sigh, yeah
I tried to go back, as if I could
All spec house and plywood
Tore up and tore up good
Down on Copperline
It doesn't come as a surprise to me
It doesn't touch my memory
Man I'm lifting up and rising free
Down on over Copperline
Half a mile down to Morgan Creek
I'm only living for the end of the week
Hercules and a hog-nosed snake
Down on Copperline yeah
Take me down on Copperline
Oh down on Copperline
Take me down on Copperline There's something in the way she moves
Or looks my way or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
And if I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now almost all the time
And if I'm well, you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now
Quite a long, long time and I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
And to silently remind me
Of the happiness and good times that I know

Just got to know them, it isn't what she's got to say
Or how she thinks and where she's been
To me the words are nice the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
She says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now almost all the time
And if I'm well, you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now
Quite a long, long time and I feel fine How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
There you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
There you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby, yes I do
How sweet it is to be loved by you, feels so fine
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby, whoa yes
How sweet it is to be loved by you (it's just like sugar sometimes)
How sweet it is to be loved by you, whoa yeah
You were better to me than I was to myself
For me there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby, oh yes
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh now, how sweet it is to be loved by you
It's like jelly baby, oh now
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Just like honey to the bee, baby, yeah now
How sweet it is to be loved by you Moving in silent desperation
Keeping an eye on the Holy Land
A hypothetical destination
Say, who is this walking man?
Well, the leaves have come to turning
And the goose has gone to fly
And bridges are for burning
So don't you let that yearning
Pass you by
Walking man, walking man walks
Well, any other man stops and talks
But the walking man walks
Well the frost is on the pumpkin
And the hay is in the barn yeah
And Pappy's come to rambling on
Stumbling around drunk
Down on the farm
And the walking man walks
Doesn't know nothing at all
Any other man stops and talks
But the walking man walks on by
Walk on by
Most everybody's got seed to sow
It ain't always easy for a weed to grow, no no
So he don't hoe the row for no one
For sure one's always missing
And something is never quite right
Ah, but who would want to listen to you
Kissing his existence good night
Walking man walk on by my door
Well, any other man stops and talks
But not the walking man
He's the walking man
Born to walk
Walk on walking man
Well now, would he have wings to fly
Oh would he be free
Golden wings against the sky
Walking man, walk on by
So long, walking man, so long If I keep on talking now
I'll only start repeating myself
And all I can say is
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
If I slip and tip my hand
I'm certain to scare you away
Then what would I say?
I'd be hurting, I'm certain
I'd be uncool to let you know
That you're the one
The fool who jumped the gun
Cause I've been advised by other guys
You've left behind
Your good byes are somewhat unrefined
But if I play my role just right
Tonight could be my lucky night
And you could be mine
If I present it to you
With a flower in the moonlight
Shiny and new
Well, you couldn't say no tonight
If I keep my heart out of sight
If I play my role just right
Then tonight could be my lucky night
And you could be mine
If I present it to you
With a flower in the moonlight
Oh shiny and new
Well, you couldn't say no tonight
If I keep my heart out of sight When this old world starts a-getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no
So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street
On the roof, that's the only place I know
Look at the city, baby
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof
And at night the stars, they put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
That's what I said, keep on telling you
That right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this old world starts a-getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof, up on the roof, up on the roof oh now
Everything is all right, every thing is all right, come on
Put down what you're doing tonight
And climb up the stairs with me and see me
You got the stars above and the city lights below oh whoa
Come on up the roof now I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Oh darling it's cold outside
This evening has been
Just hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Oh beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some music on while I pour
The neighbors will think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink
There's no cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, sir
Mind if I move in a little closer
At least I'm going to say that I tried
Oh, what's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
What are you doing with your coat?
You don't need your coat
Why are you putting your coat on for?
It's warm out here
You don't understand

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
Ooh, the answer is no
Oh darling, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Please but your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh but your lips look delicious
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
There was never such a blizzard before
Ooh, I got to go home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I trill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Ah, but it's cold outside

Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
It's cold outside, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
You know that it's, you know that it's cold outside
Ah, it's cold outside

Darling as a friend
Sure James
As a friend you, you must stay and, and warm up by this fire little bit
Let me get you, let me get you a hot toddy or something
Well, I really can't my mother will worry about me
People are so suspicious, it's just an innocent suggesting
You stay warm and keep yourself healthy that's all
It's nippy out there, it's cold
Oh, you know that drink does look kinda nice
It is a perfectly nice drink

Baby, it's cold out, baby, it's cold, it's warm
Baby, it's cold out, baby, it's cold outside The water is wide
I can't cross over
And neither have
I wings to fly
Build me a boat
That can carry two
And both shall row
My love and I
There is a ship
And she sails the sea
She's loaded deep
As deep can be
But not so deep
As the love I'm in
I know not how
I sink or swim
Oh love is handsome
And love is fine
The sweetest flower
When first it's new
But love grows old
And waxes cold
And fades away
Like summer dew
Build me a boat
That can carry two
And both shall row
My love and I
And both shall row
My love and I I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Had I listened to the grapevine
I might have had my doubts
But I did my level best
Just to block them out
Cause love is so unwise
And love has no eyes
And it took a while for a fool to see
What his friends were on about
Well I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care yeah
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Imagining your face
It almost fills the empty space before me
I can see you eyes
And almost hear your lovely lies oh yeah
I wish I was an old man
And love was through with me
I wish I was a baby
On my mama's knee
I wish I was a freight train
Moving down the line
Just to keep in track of time
Without all these memories
Well I was a fool to care
Well I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care hey
But I don't care even if I was a fool
I'm still in love with you
Baby, yes, I am
I could have opened my eyes
I could have seen through your lies
I could have stood for no more
I could have walked out the door
But I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
Well I was a fool to care
And I was a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool to care) You weren't nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool to care) Just a country fool to care Long ago, but not so very long ago
The world was different, oh yes, it was
You settled down and you built a town and made it live
And you watched it grow, it was your town
Time goes by, time brings changes, you changed too
Nothing comes that you can't handle, so on you go
You never see it coming when the world caves in on you
On your town, nothing you can do
Main street isn't main street anymore
Lights don't shine as brightly as they shone before
To tell the truth, lights don't shine at all
In our town
Sun comes up each morning, just like it's always done
Get up, go to work, start a new day
You open up for business that's never going to come
As the world rolls by a million miles away
Main street isn't main street anymore
No one seems to need us like they did before
It's hard to find a reason left to stay
But it's our town, love it anyway
Come what may, it's our town Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women living on the Earth
Ties of hope and love, sister- and brotherhood
That we are bound together
In our desire to see the world become
A place in which our children
Can grow free and strong
We are bound together
By the task that stands before us
And the road that lies ahead
We are bound and we are bound
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps the heart will never rest
Shed a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord)
So that we can see (oh now)
Just a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord)
I want to stand it on up (stand it on up, oh Lord)
Stand it on up, oh Lord (yeah now)
I want to walk it on down (oh shed a little light)
Shed a little light, oh Lord
Can't get no light from the dollar bill
Don't give me no light from a TV screen (no, no, no, no)
When I open my eyes
I wanna drink my fill
From the well on the hill (I know ya know what I mean)
Shed a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord)
So that we can see (ah ah yeah)
Just a little light, oh Lord (shed a little light, oh Lord, oh now)
I want to stand it on up (stand it on up)
Stand it on up, oh Lord (yeah now)
I want to walk it on down (oh shed a little light)
Shed a little light, oh Lord
Shed a little light, o Lord
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps the heart will never rest
Oh, let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women living on the Earth
Ties of hope and love, sister- and brotherhood Well the sun is surely sinkin' down
But the moon is slowly risin'
So this old world must still be spinnin' around
And I still love you

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone

It won't be long before another day
We gonna have a good time
And no one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone I remember Richard Nixon back in '74
And the final scene at the White House door
And the staff lined up to say good-bye
Tiny tear in his shifty little eye
He said, ""Nobody knows me
Nobody understands
These little people were good to me
Oh I'm gonna shake some hands
Somebody line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up""
Ah at that time my heart was all broke
I looked like ashes and smelled like smoke
And I turned away from my loving kind
Tried to leave my body and live in my mind
But it's much too much emotion
To hold it in your hand
They've got waves out on the ocean
They gonna wear away the land
I say line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up ah
Oh, I've seen corn in Kansas
And I've seen picket fences
And certain cowboy dances
I've gone lining up for shows
I've been safely placed in rows
Sure I know how it goes
Another day goes by, little time machine
I'm raking my brain over what it might mean
Just to claim the time and to turn away
Make today today
Who waits for you, lonely tired old toad?
It's your life laid out before you
Like the broken white line
Down the center of the doggone road
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Easy just to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Yeah, big moon landing
People all standing up
Smile for the loved ones
They go walking on down the aisles
Each re-engages
Stepping into the sun
I watch them turn like pages
One by one by one
Somebody line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Line 'em up, line 'em all up
Want you to line 'em up, line 'em all up
Easy just to line 'em all up
It works when you line 'em up, line 'em all up
Can't you just line 'em up, line 'em all up So the sun shines on this funeral
Just the same as on a birth
The way it shines on everything
That happens here on Earth
It rolls across the Western sky
And back into the sea
And spends the day's last rays
Upon this fucked-up family
So long old pal
The last time I saw Alice
She was leaving Santa Fe
With a bunch of round-eyed Buddhists
In a killer Chevrolet
Said they turned her out of Texas
Yeah she burned them down back home
Now she's wild with expectation
On the edge of the unknown
Singing oh, it's enough to be on your way
It's enough to cover ground
It's enough to be moving on
Home, build it behind your eyes
Carry it in your heart
Safe among your own
They brought her back on a Friday night
Same day I was born
We sent her up the smokestack
Yes and back into the storm
She blew up over the San Juan Mountains
She spent herself at last
The threat of heavy weather
That was what she knew the best
Oh, it's enough to be on your way
It's enough just to cover ground
It's enough to be moving on
Home, better build it behind your eyes
Carry it in your heart
Safe among your own
It woke me up on a Sunday
An hour before the sun
It had me watching them headlights
Out on Highway 591
Till I stepped into my trousers
Till I pulled my big boots on
I walked out on the Mesa
And I stumbled on this song
Oh, it's enough to be on your way
It's enough to cover ground
It's enough to be moving on
Home, boy, build it behind your eyes
Carry it in your heart
Safe among your own
So long, old gal We were ring-around-the-rosy children
They were circles around the sun
Never give up
Never slow down
Never grow old, never ever die young
Synchronized with the rising moon
Even with the evening star
They were true love written in stone
They were never alone
They were never that far apart
And we who couldn't bear
To believe they might make it
We got to close our eyes
Cut up our losses into doable doses
Ration our tears and sighs
Oh, you could see them
On the street on a Saturday night
Everyone used to run them down
They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight
Not enough tough for this town
Couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole
No, it didn't seem to rattle at all
They were glued together body and soul
That much more
With their backs up against the wall
Oh, hold them up
Hold them up
Never do let them fall
Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin
That names us and claims us and shames us all
I guess it had to happen someday soon
Wasn't nothing to hold them down
They would rise from among us like a big balloon
Take the sky
Forsake the ground
Oh, yes, other hearts were broken
Yeah, other dreams ran dry
But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky
(Let other hearts be broken
Let other dreams run dry)
But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky
Beneath another sky
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
(Hold them up
Don't let them fall) I was born singing yes I am
Grew up some kind of travelin’ man
Sunday morning, pack my things
Say so long sweet potato
I’m on the road again

Oh it’s a lovely stretch of the highway
Leading me on
And my favorite thing is to miss my home
When I’m gone, soon as I’m gone

Chi-Town baby, that’s my town too
People pick it right on up, do the looma lamaloo
Just for example, look at ye yonder
Chicago’s got the finest high-test first-class
Poontang anywhere

Oh it’s a lovely stretch of the highway
Leading me on
And my favorite thing is to miss my home
When I’m gone, soon as I’m gone

I want to thank the man that planed the land
I want to thank the man that towed the load
In the burning sun and the freezing cold
I want to thank the man that made this road
Eisenhower
Mr. Dwight D
General Motors
Big Ol’ GMC
They saw the future
Yes, indeed
Eternal combustion
That’s what the country’s gonna need

Oh it’s a lovely stretch of the highway
Leading me on
And my favorite thing is to miss my home
When I’m gone
When I’m gone
Soon as I’m gone
Tomorrow
Same as today
One more time
Mama that’s ok
Shake your head “yes”
Shake your head “no”
Keep it straight and level
And steady as she goes
Steady as she goes
I'm gonna ride around
I wanna thank the man
Steady as she goes
I wanna thank the man
I wanna thank the man Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name?
Your way and my way
They seem to be one and the same
Mama don't understand it
She wants to know where I've been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
But you know I could feel it
On a country road
Sail on home to Jesus
Won't you, good girls and boys?
I'm all in pieces
You can have your own choice
But I can hear a heavenly band full of angels
And they're comin' to set me free
I don't know nothin' about the why or when
But I can tell you that it's bound to be
Because I could feel it, child, yeah
On a country road
I guess my feet know
Where they want me to go
Walkin' on a country road
Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name?
Your way and my way
They seem to be one and the same, child
Mama don't understand it
She wants to know where I've been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
But I could feel it, Lord
On a country road
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down
Walk on down a country road
La la la la la
Country road oh yeah
Walkin' on a country road
Country road woah
Country road Do me wrong, do me right
Tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
Say goodbye and say hello
Sure enough good to see you, but it's time to go
Don't say yes but please don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight
Go away then, damn you, go on and do as you please yeah
You ain't gonna see me gettin' down on my knees
I'm undecided, and your heart's been divided
You've been turnin' my world upside down
Do me wrong, do me right right now, baby
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light, morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight, no, no
I don't want to be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight Back home Indiana, we just learn to get along
Civilized and socialized they teach you right from wrong
How to hold your liquor and how to hold your tongue
How to hold a woman or a baby or a gun
But nothing will prepare you for the far Afghanistan
You can listen to their stories and pick up what you can
You listen to their stories maybe read a book or two
Until they send you out there, man you haven’t got a clue
Oh the Hindu Kush, the Band-e Amir, the Hazara
They tell you a tradition in the hills of Kandahar
They say young boys are taken to the wilderness out there
Taken to the mountain alone and in the night
If he makes it home alive they teach him how to fight
They fought against the Russians, they fought against the Brits
They fought old Alexander, talking ‘bout him ever since
And after 9/11 here comes your Uncle Sam
Another painful lesson in the far Afghanistan
I was ready to be terrified and ready to be mad
I was ready to be homesick, the worst I’ve ever had
I expected to be hated and insulted to my face
But nothing could prepare me for the beauty of the place
No matter what they tell you all soldiers talk to God
It’s a private conversation written in your blood
The enemy’s no different, badass holy wind
That crazy bastard talks to God and his God talks back to him Well, I'm a steamroller, babe
I'm bound to roll all over you
Yes, I'm a steamroller now, baby
I'm bound to roll all over you
I'm gonna inject your soul with some sweet rock and roll
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues
Well, I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
Yes I'm a cement mixer for you, babe
A churning urn of burning funk
Well, I'm a demolition derby, yeah
A hefty hunk of steaming junk
Now I'm a napalm bomb, babe
Just guaranteed to blow your mind
Yeah, I'm a napalm bomb for you, baby
Whoa guaranteed, just stone guaranteed to blow your mind
And if I can't have your love for my own now
Sweet child, won't be nothing left behind
It seems how lately, babe
Got a bad case of steamroller blues There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye
An' it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'rything's goin' my way
All the cattle are standin' like statues
All the cattle are standin' like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'rything's goin' my way
All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And a ol' weepin' willer is laughin' at me!
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'rything's goin' my way
Oh, what a beautiful day 86 summers gone by
Bambino put a hex on the Bean
We were living on a tear and a sigh
In the shadow of the Bronx machine
Man, you could feel it smoulder
The whole town had an attitude
Then you'd get a little chip on your shoulder
Say something that's downright rude
Oh, damn them Yankees
Outspending everybody two to one
Picking up on the cream of the crop
Stealing everyone's favorite son

Angels of Fenway, hear our prayer
We have been chastened
We have been patient

Grandmama was a Fenway fan
Even after Grandad died
I still remember her holding my hand
Taking me along for the ride
She was born in 1918
Last year that the Red Sox won
Back then when they sold the Babe
Something that they never should've ever have done

Hey, Nanna can I have another Coke?
Here comes the hotdog man
Look at that, his bat just broke
Gee, that's got to kill his hand

Riding home on the Green Line
Watching the town go by
Nanna made another Red Sox fan
'Til the day I die
That was back in '65
It doesn't seem like a long time ago
Grandmama keeping hope alive
Watched them win in '004
Oh my God, it was beyond belief
Down three, needing four in a row
Holding on by the skin of our teeth
Like a hungry dog on a bone

Angels of Fenway, give them peace
They have been patient, Red Sox Nation

The whole world held its breath
People got down on their knees
Ready for the sudden death
Praying to heaven for hell to freeze
Nanna watched from her hospital bed
She was there 'til the end of the race
I couldn't hear the last words she said
But she was lying there with a smile on her face
Just a little smile on her face
It doesn't feel like a long time ago... Last thing I remember is the freezing cold
Water reaching up just to swallow me whole
Ice in the rigging and howling wind
Shock to my body as we tumbled in (mercy from God)
My brothers and the others are lost at sea
I alone am returned to tell thee
Hidden in ice for a century
To walk the world again
Lord have mercy
On the frozen man
Next words that were spoken to me
Nurse asked me what my name might be
She was all in white at the foot of my bed
I said Angel of Mercy I'm alive or am I dead?
My name is William James McPhee
I was born in 1843
Raised in Liverpool by the sea
But that ain't who I am
Lord have mercy
On the frozen man
It took a lot of money to start my heart
To peg my leg and to buy my eye
The newspapers call me state of the art
And the children, when they see me, cry
I thought it would be nice just to visit my grave
See what kind of tombstone I might have
I saw my wife and my daughter and it seemed so strange
Both of them dead and gone from extreme old age
See here, when I die make sure I'm gone
Don't leave them nothing to work on
You can raise your arm, you can wiggle your hand (not unlike myself)
And you can wave goodbye to the frozen man
I know what it means to freeze to death
To lose a little life with every breath
To say goodbye to life on earth
And come around again
Lord have mercy
On the frozen man
Lord have mercy
On the frozen man Well I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee
And I'm bound for Louisiana
My own true love for to see

It did rain all night the day I left
The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry

I said, oh! Susanna
Now you don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama
With this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill

Now the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
The tear was in her eye
I said that I come from Dixie Land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry More than a distant land
Over a shining sea
More than the steaming green
More than the shining eyes
Well they tell me it's only a dream in Rio
And nothing could be as sweet
As it seems on this very first day down
They remind me: ""Son, have you so soon forgotten?
Often as not it's rotten inside and the mask soon slips away""
Strange taste of a tropical fruit
Romantic language of the Portuguese
Melody on a wooden flute
Samba floating in the summer breeze
Take it easy
It's alright you can stay asleep
You can close your eyes
You can trust the people of paradise
To call your keeper
And tender your goodbyes
Oh what a night, wonderful one in a million
Frozen fire, Brazilian stars
Oh holy Southern Cross
Later on take me way downtown in a tin can, I
Can't come down from the bandstand, I'm
Never thrown for such a loss when they say:
Quando a nossa mãe acordar
Andaremos ao sol
Quando a nossa mãe acordar
Cantará pelo sertão
Quando a nossa mãe acordar
Todos os filhos saberão
E regozijarão
Caught in the rays of the rising sun
On the run from the soldier's gun
Shouting out loud from the angry crowd
The mild the wild and the hungry child
I'll tell you there's more than a dream in Rio
I was there on the very day
And my heart came back alive
There was more
More than the singing voices
More than the upturned faces
And more than the shining eyes
But it's more than the shining eye
More than the steaming green
More than the hidden hills
More than the concrete Christ
More than a distant land
Over a shining sea
More than a hungry child
More like another time
Born of a million years
More than a million years The secret of life is enjoying the passage of time
Any fool can do it
There ain't nothing to it
Nobody knows how we got to the top of the hill
But since we're on our way down
We might as well enjoy the ride
The secret of love is in opening up your heart
It's okay to feel afraid
But don't let that stand in your way
Because anyone knows that love is the only road
And since we're only here for a while
Might as well show some style
Give us a smile
Isn't it a lovely ride?
Sliding down, gliding down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
Now the thing about time is that time isn't really real
It's just your point of view
How does it feel for you?
Einstein said he could never understand it all
Planets a-spinning through space
The smile upon your face
Welcome to the human race
Some kind of lovely ride
I'll be sliding down
I'll be gliding down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
Isn't it a lovely ride?
See me sliding down
Gliding down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
The secret of life is enjoying the passage of time Everyday, it's a-getting closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Yeah everyday, seems a little faster
All my friends
They say: ''Go on up and ask her''
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Oh everyday it seems a little stronger
And everyday it lasts a little longer
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?
Like I long for you, baby
Said everyday seems a little closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Yes a love like yours would surely
Come my way, everyday
Everyday yeah
Everyday
Each and every day, yeah
Everyday it seems a little stronger
And you know it lasts a little longer
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?

Said everyday seems a little closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Come my way
Oh everyday
I said everyday baby

Everyday everyday everyday Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus is born

Shepherds watching, over the flocks by night
And out of the darkness, shone a heavenly light
Feared and they trembled high above the earth
Singing in angel chorus telling of the Saviors birth

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus is born

Guess I was a seeker, I saw them both night and day
Asked the Lord to help me, He showed me the way
Down in the manger the humble child was born
God sent us salvation on that Christmas morn

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus is born
Go tell it on the mountain (tell it on the mountain)
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain

Jesus Christ is born You are my only one, you are my only one
Well I'm telling you now, now you're my only one
I've got two long legs like to carry me
Two sharp eyes to look for the light
Two strong arms to hold on tight
Two good friends on my left and right
But only one only one
And you are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now, now you're my only one
Now there's only one road before me
Too many turns in the way
Thousands of things to do today
Millions of moments, I must admit
But only one only one
And you are my only one, you are my only one
Well I'm telling you now, now you're my only one
Taken for granted and pushed aside
All that it wanted was a place to run and hide
Missing message in a hollow tree
Hidden deep inside a memory
And the memory seems like dreams
Hundreds of hopes in the past
Nevertheless it was never the last
Hold on strong or you fade out fast
And only one only one
Oh you are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now, and I'm telling you now
You are my only one
You are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now, now you're my only one
Yeah you are my only one, you are my only one
Well I'm telling you now, now you're my only one
Yeah you are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Oh you are my only one, you are my only one
Well I'm telling you now, now you're my only one
Oh you are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Oh you are my only one, you are my only one People around me are at it again
God only knows how they do it
One to another then back again
Something keeps putting them through it
Me, I've been watching more than fifteen years
And it hasn't changed a bit
People keep talking about a different line
But it never seems to fit
This is a song for you far away, far away
This is a song for you far away from me
This is a song for you far away, so far away
This is a song for you far away from me
Sitting here all alone
Is bringing it on again, I'm gone again
Sitting here thinking of you
Is driving it home again yeah
This is a song for you far away, so far away
This is a song for you far away from me
Open the door it takes me back
Oh it takes me back
Mention your name and I'm gone again
Oh I'm gone again
This is a song for you far away from me
And you'refar away from me
Talking about far away
Far away from me She's been afraid to go out
She's afraid of the knock on her door
There's always a shade of a doubt
She can never be sure

Who comes to call?
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend
Anyone at all
Anything but nothing again
 
It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too

Seems like even her old girlfriends
Might be talking her down
She's got her name on the grapevine
Running up and down the telephone line

Talking 'bout someone said someone said something 'bout
Something else someone might have said about her
She always figured that they were her friends
But maybe they can live without her
 

Well, people gotten used to seeing them both together
But now he's gone and life goes on
Nothing lasts forever, oh no

She gets the house and the garden
He gets the boys in the band
Some of them his friends, some of them her friends
Some of them understand

Lord knows that this is just a small town city, yes
And everyone can see you fall
It's got nothing to do with pity
I just wanted to give you a call

It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too
You never know until it all falls down
Somebody loves you, somebody loves you
Darling, somebody still loves you
I can still remember her
When it used to be her town, too

It used to your town, it used to be my town, too
You never know until it all falls down
Somebody loves you, somebody loves you Before this world was as we know it now
Before the land and sea were formed at all
Before the stars were made to burn and shine
Little love of mine, darling one
Who can pretend to understand at all
No one can both inside and outside be
Who can suppose he knows the way this goes
Little lamb, never mind
So let us love and let us not delay
The world is old and it will never last
Our share of joy is in this moment past
Will you come away, come away
Fall into Jesus baby child
Give up the love that takes and breaks your heart
Let go the weight of all that holds you here
Little love of mine, darling one

Oh the jolly springtime
In the merry month of May
Oh the heavenly hours
Oh the come again day

Let the day run long
Let the river run high
That tomorrow may live
So must yesterday die
Let the resin risin’ up in the tree
Make the green leaf bud
The bird and the bee and the fish in the sea
Feeling it in my blood

Oh the jolly springtime
All in the merry month of May
Oh the heavenly hours
Oh the come again day

Yes the winter was bitter and long
So the spring’ll be sweet
Come along with a rhythm and a song
Watch creation repeat
Thin thin the moment is thin
Ever so narrow the now
Everybody say got to live in today
Don’t nobody know how

Oh the jolly springtime
In the merry month of May
Oh the heavenly hours
Oh the come again day Watchin’ over me when I was high
Holdin’ my hand and wipin’ my eye
Watchin’ me cheat, watchin’ me lie
Oh watchin’ over me
Lookin’ back over on the damage I done
Made no kind of plan to be carryin’ on
Thought I might ought to been dead and gone
I said oh the damage done
How’m I gonna pay that debt I owe
Big red Jesus on the radio
Down on my knees after the show
I said oh the debt I owe
I learned my lesson again
Well, I learned my lesson again
Only one way to surrender
Learned my lesson again
Got to return it to sender
Leave a little light in the window
Got to remember my friend
Guess I got to say it’s a lovely day
Nice enough to know it could ever be so
Ready man, steady man, here I’m gonna go
I said, oh, the lovely day Here's a story about Jelly Man Kelly
He loves jelly the most
Ah but most of all Jelly Man Kelly
Loves jelly on toast

Here's a story about Jelly Man Kelly
He sure loves jelly
And maybe someday you an me friend
We can have tea with him Now I'm just a bartender and I don't like my work
But I don't mind the money at all
I see a lots of sad faces, a lots of bad cases
Of folks with their backs to the wall
But I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away
I can light up your smokes
I can laugh at your jokes
I can watch you fall down on your knees
I can close down this bar
I can gas up my car
I can pack up and mail in my key
But I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away
Now, the smoke fills the air in this honky-tonk bar
And I'm thinking about where I'd rather be
But I burned all my bridges, I sank all my ships
And I'm stranded at the edge of the sea
But I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
I need a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away Person to person
And man to man
I'm back in touch
With my long lost friend
Listen to reason
And understand
And think of me
From way back when
He said: ""Me and Melissa
Well we fell out of love
We ran out of luck
Seems like lightning struck
I've been thinking of leaving
But I can't raise a buck
James, I'm wondering
Could I borrow your truck?
I said: ""That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Got no better reason
That's why I'm standing before you (that's why I'm here)
That's why I'm here""
John's gone
Found dead
He dies high
He's brown bread
Later said to have drowned in his bed
After the laughter
The wave of the dread
It hits us like a ton of lead
It seems ""learn not to burn""
Means to turn on a dime
And walk on if you're walking
Even if it's an uphill climb
And try to remember
That working's no crime
Just don't let them take
And waste your time
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
There'll be no more messes tonight
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Whoa, that's why I'm here
This is an IOU
I reckon I owe you one now
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria
This'll be better tomorrow
Fortune and fame's
Such a curious game
Perfect strangers
Can call you by name
Pay good money
To hear Fire and Rain
Again and again
And again
Some are like summer
Coming back every year
Got your baby
Got your blanket
Got your bucket of beer
I break into a grin
From ear to ear
And suddenly
It's perfectly clear
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Sing it tonight, tomorrow and everyday
That's why I'm standing (that's why I'm here)
Oh that's why I'm here
This is the part
About Kitty and Bim
He loved her
And she loved him
Wake them up
Shake them up
The middle of the night
Got to tell me everything's alright
Sayin, that's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
You got me walking and talking like a natural man
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
That's why I'm here
That's right I've been wandering
Early late
From New York City
To the Golden Gate
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering
My daddy was an engineer
My brother drives a hack
My sister takes in laundry
While the baby balls the jack
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering
I've been in the army
I've worked on a farm
And all I've got to show
Is the muscle in my arm
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering
My ma she died
When I was young
My daddy took to stealing
And he got hung
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering
Snakes in the ocean
Eels in the sea
I let a redheaded woman
Make a fool out of me
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering
Well I've been wandering
Early late
From the New York City
To the Golden Gate
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering
No, it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wandering Long ago, a young man sits
And plays his waitin' game
But things are not the same
It seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships
And Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see
Are things not meant to be
Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love
To love is just a word I've heard
When things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me
Cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been
And what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas
And bits of broken glass
Where do your golden rainbows end?
Why is this song I sing so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love
To love to love to love
Oh no no no On my own, how could I have known? Imagine my surprise
Just a fool from a tree full of fools who can't believe his eyes, imagine my surprise?
I was a mean old man, I was an ornery cuss, I was a dismal Dan, I made an awful fuss
Ever since my life began, man, it was ever thus, I was a nasty tyke who was hard to like
I had to misbehave, I did things in reverse
Refused to wash or shave, I was horrid to my nurse
I got back what I gave which only made me worse
I had to have my way which was bleak and gray
Oh dear, living in here, one hundred years of rain
Such a drag, this riches to rags with just myself to blame, a dirty low-down shame
Silly me, silly old me, somewhere outside my mind
Clever you walking me through, willing to lead the blind just in the nick of time
Who gets a second chance? Who gets to have some fun?
Who gets to learn to dance before his race is run?
Who gets to shed his skin? Who comes up born again?
Who was a mean old man till you turned him into a golden retriever puppy dog?

Who's a good boy? You and I again, these days go by
And I wish that I could slow the whole thing down
Have it all back again, just one more time
Then again maybe we can't cause I can't escape this feeling
That we've been this way together you and I
There you are again, I climbed so high
High enough to finally see your side
Shining in the distance, you were tending your own fire
We were biding our time
We were both waiting for the moment
When our backs would come together you and I
I see how fierce you are, never this world would drag us down
How serious you are standing on Holy ground
And so although I know we are only small
In the time we have here surely we have it all
I see how fierce you are, never this world would drag us down
How serious you are standing on Holy ground
And so although I know we are only small
In the time we have here surely we have it all
You and I again, this time, this time Little one done run out of money now, no, it doesn't seem to have a home
Left to fend for yourself in the wilderness, out there living life all alone

Whenever you're ready, you could see a dream come true
Whenever you're ready, I'm just saying it's up to you
Whenever you're ready, things could start looking up
Whenever you're ready, take a big sip from the loving cup

Making that face carved out of stone, coping real hard with a losing hand
Sound of a dog choking on a chicken bone
It just can't be the way that you had things planned, my friend

Whenever you're ready, yeah, yeah, things could start to happen real fast
Whenever you're ready, my good friend, sure we could get one built to last
Whenever you're ready, oh, we could get it done today
Whenever you're ready, sure enough you could come out and play

Cold, hot, ready or not, whatever you've got
What have you got to lose, my good friend?
Whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready, my good friend Oh the summertime is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, will you go
And we will all go together
To pick wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, will you go
I will build my love a bower
By yon pure and crystal fountain
Yes and on it I will lay
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go, lassie, will you go
And we will all go together
To pick wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, will you go
If my true love won’t come with me
I will surely find another
To pick wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go, lassie, will you go
And we will all go together
To pick wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go
Will you go, lassie, will you go Today, today, today
I’m finally on my way
The time has come to say
Today, today, today
I’m finally on my way
The time has come to say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
The bird is on the wing
The bell is about to ring
The big girl she’s about to sing
Today, today, today
The world will open wide
And I’m running with the tide
It’s time to cut this side
And I must not miss my ride
Somehow I haven’t died
And I feel the same inside
As when I caught this ride
When first I sold my pride
The way ahead is clear
My heart is free from fear
I’ll plant my flag right here
Today, today, today Damn this traffic jam
How I hate to be late
It hurts my motor to go so slow
Damn this traffic jam
Time I get home my supper will be cold
Damn this traffic jam
Well I left my job about 5 o'clock
It took fifteen minutes to go three blocks
Just in time to stand in line
With a freeway looking like a parking lot
Damn this traffic jam
How I hates to be late
It hurts my motor to go so slow
Damn this traffic jam
Time I get home my supper'll be cold
Damn this traffic jam
Now I almost had a heart attack
Looking in my rear view mirror
I saw myself the next car back
Looking in the rear view mirror
About to have a heart attack
I said damn this traffic jam
How I hate to be late
It hurts my motor to go so slow
Time I get home my supper'll be cold
Damn this traffic jam
Now when I die I don't want no coffin
I thought about it all too often
Just strap me in behind the wheel
And bury me with my automobile
Damn this traffic jam
How I hate to be late
It hurts my motor to go so slow
Damn this traffic jam
Time I get home my supper'll be cold
Damn this traffic jam
Damn
Now I used to think that I was cool
Running around on fossil fuel
Until I saw what I was doing
Was driving down the road to ruin Some children see Him lily white
The baby Jesus born this night
Some children see Him lily white
With tresses soft and fair
Some children see Him bronzed and brown
The Lord of heaven to earth come down
Some children see Him bronzed and brown
With dark and heavy hair
Some children see Him almond-eyed
This Savior whom we kneel beside
Some children see Him almond-eyed
With skin of yellow hue
Some children see Him dark as they
Sweet Mary's Son to whom we pray
Some children see him dark as they
And, ah! they love Him, too!
The children in each different place
Will see the baby Jesus' face
Like theirs, but bright with heavenly grace
And filled with holy light
O lay aside each earthly thing
And with thy heart as offering
Come worship now the infant King
It is love that's born tonight! Sunny Skies sleeps in the morning
He doesn't know when to rise
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
Look at him yawning
Throwing his morning hours away
He knows how to ease down slowly
Everything is fine in the end
And you will be pleased to know
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend
Sunny Skies weeps in the evening
It doesn't much matter why
I guess he just has to cry from time to time
Everyone's leaving
Sunny Skies has to stay behind
Still he knows how to ease down slow
Everything is fine in the end
And you will be pleased to know
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend
Sunny Skies sleeps in the morning
He doesn't know when to rise
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
And throws it all away
Looking at the snow and trees that grow outside my window
Looking at the things that pass me by
Wondering if where I've been is worth the things I've been through
Ending with a friend named Sunny Skies I'm not smart enough for this life I've been livin'
A little bit slow for the pace of the dream
It's not I'm ungrateful for all I've been given
But nevertheless, just the same
I wish to my soul I was back in Montana
High on my mountain and deep in the snow
Back in my cabin over the valley
And under the blankets with you

Over the ocean from here
Over the mountains from there

Who can imagine the scale of the forces
That pushed this old mountain range up in the sky?
Tectonic creation, erosion, mutation
Somethin' to pleasure God's eye
The world is a wonder of lightnin' and thunder
And green of the ground as we fall from the sky
The old and new faces, the tribes and the races
Thousands of places to try

Over the ocean from here
Over the mountains from there

One sits and waits while the other one wanders
And squanders his time with a life on the road
Down from the mountain, across the wide ocean
The world is in motion and cannot be slowed
Enough for today... the demands of the moment
The thing on my mind is the work in my hand
Wood for the woodstove and water for coffee
Somethin' I can still understand
We got a few friends but not many neighbors
The trip into town takes us most of the day
And after, ""Hello"", and ""it's sure good to see you""
It seems like there's nothin' to say

Over the ocean from here Walk down that lonesome road all by yourself
Don't turn your head back over your shoulder
And only stop to rest yourself
When the silver moon
Is shining high above the trees
If I had stopped to listen once or twice
If I had closed my mouth and opened my eyes
If I had cooled my head and warmed my heart
I'd not be on this road tonight
Carry on, carry on
Never mind feeling sorry for yourself
It doesn't save you from your troubled mind
Walk down that lonesome road all by yourself
Don't turn your head back over your shoulder
And only stop to rest yourself
When the silver moon
Is shining high above the trees How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
For I needed the shelter of someones arms
Darlin', there you were
When I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs
Oh, baby, there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I just can't stop, just to thank you, baby
I just want to stop, just to thank you, baby, yes I do
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Well I'm gonna close my eyes at night now
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
And everything I was into which was just a bore
And everywhere I went I'd think I've been here before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop just to thank you, baby
I just want to stop just to thank you, baby, thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you, baby, there ain't nobody else
I gotta stop so I can thank you, baby
I just want to stop like to thank you baby, yeah now
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Let's bring it on now
Well I just gotta stop and thank you, baby get down
And I think so strong, the feeling's so right
Stop and thank you, baby, baby
Love thing, love thing
Love thing, love thing
Gotta stop and thank you, baby
I say well now, well now, well now
Well now, well now, well now
Well now, well now, well now
Well now, well now, well now baby
To be loved be you
It's like a honey to the bee, baby
Sugar to the sugarcane
Jelly to the don't love
It's like a walk to a lonely man
Over and over
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved, yeah
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is
And it feels just about right
Feels alright tonight
To be loved by you Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way
Lately I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen
Melt my cares away

Send the sunshine down my way
Whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me
Girl, it's all the same

Blossom, there's an empty road behind
Sit you down beside me
Blossom, there's a sweet dream on my mind
There's a song inside me
Take these chains away

Now send the sunshine down my way
Whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me
Girl, it's all the same

Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way
Lately I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen
Melt my cares away

La la la la la la la Now my grandfather was a sailor, he blew in off the water
My father was a farmer and I, his only daughter
Took up with a no good millworking man from Massachusetts
Who dies from too much whiskey and leaves me these three faces to feed
Millwork ain't easy, millwork ain't hard
Millwork it ain't nothing but an awful boring job
I'm waiting for a daydream to take me through the morning
And put me in my coffee break where I can have a sandwich and remember
Then it's me and my machine for the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon and the rest of my life
Now my mind begins to wander to the days back on the farm
I can see my father smiling at me, swinging on his arm
I can hear my granddad's stories of the storms out on Lake Erie
Where vessels and cargoes and fortunes and sailors' lives were lost
Yes, but it's my life has been wasted, and I have been the fool
To let this manufacturer use my body for a tool
I can ride home in the evening, staring at my hands
Swearing by my sorrow that a young girl ought to stand a better chance
So may I work the mills just as long as I am able
And never meet the man whose name is on the label
It be me and my machine for the rest of the morning
And the rest of the afternoon, gone for the rest of my life Lonely by day, empty and cold
Only to say lo and behold
Deep in the night, down in my dreams
Glorious sight this soul has seen

There's a well on the hill
You just can't kill for Jesus
There's a well on the hill
Let it be
Don't build no heathen temples
Where the Lord has done laid his hand now
There's a well on the hill
Let it be

Everyone's talking 'bout the gospel story
Some shall sink and some shall rise
Everyone's talking 'bout the train to glory
Long, long time till it gets here to you, baby

There's a well on the hill
You just can't kill for Jesus
There's a well on the hill
Let it be
Now don't build no heathen temples
Where the Lord has done laid a hand
There's a well on the hill
Let it be Well, I'm a steamroller, baby
I'm bound to roll all over you
Yes, I'm a steamroller, baby
I'm bound to roll all over you
I'm gonna inject your soul with some sweet rock 'n roll
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues
Well, I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
Yes, I'm a cement mixer for you, baby
A churning urn of burning funk
Well, I'm a demolition derby
A hefty hunk of steaming junk
Now, I'm a napalm bomb, baby
Just guaranteed to blow your mind
Yeah, I'm a napalm bomb for you, baby
Guaranteed to blow your mind
And if I can't have your love for my own
Sweet child, won't be nothing left behind
It seems how lately, baby
I'm a steamroller for you baby child Those magic men the Magi
Some people call them wise
Or Oriental, even kings
Well anyway, those guys
They visited with Jesus
They sure enjoyed their stay
Then warned in a dream of King Herod's scheme
They went home by another way
Yes, they went home by another way
Home by another way
Maybe me and you can be wise guys to
And go home by another way
We can make it another way
Safe home as they used to say
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high
And go home another way
Steer clear of royal welcomes
Avoid a big to-do
A king who would slaughter the innocents
Will not cut a deal for you
He really, really wants those presents
He'll comb your camel's fur
Until his boys announce
They've found trace amounts
Of your frankincense, gold and myrrh
And they go home by another way
Home by another way
You have to figure the Gods, saying play the odds
And go home by another way
We can make it another way
Safe home as they used to say
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high
And go home another way
Home is where they want you now
You can more or less assume
That you'll be welcome in the end
Mustn't let King Herod haunt you so
Or fantasize his features
When you're looking at a friend
Well it pleasures me to be here
And to sing this song tonight
They tell me that life is a miracle
And I figured that they're right
But Herod's always out there
He's got our cards on file
It's a lead pipe cinch
If we give an inch
Old Herod likes to take a mile
It's best to go home by another way
Home by another way
We got this far to a lucky star
But tomorrow is another day
We can make it another way
Safe home as they used to say
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high
And go home another way
Go home another way Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain
Ive seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Ive seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that Id see you again
Won't you look down upon me, jesus
Youve got to help me make a stand
Youve just got to see me through another day
My bodys aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way
Oh, Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain
Ive seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Ive seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that Id see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows itll turn your head around
Well, theres hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things
To come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain
Ive seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Ive seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that Id see you, baby, one more time again, now
Thought Id see you one more time again
Theres just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought Id see you, thought Id see you fire and rain, now It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
Putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
Yeah, but it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
You want to make a lot of money and split this crazy scene
I wish I had a river and I could skate away on

Oh, I wish I had a river so high
I could teach my feet to fly away, yeah
I wish I had a river, I could skate away on

But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
And I think, your's the only best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
She tried hard to help me, tried to put me at ease
She loved me so naughty, made me weak in my knees
Yeah, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on


And I made baby cry, and I made my baby say goodbye
And I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
I could skate away on, I could skate away on Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

And surely you'll be your pint stoup
And surely I'll be mine
And we'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne


We two have run about the braes
And pound the gowans fine
But we've wandered many a weary foot
Sin' auld lang syne


We two have paddled in the burn
From morning sun till diner
But seas between us braid have roared
Sin auld lang syne


And there's a hand, my trusty friend
And give us a hand of thine
And we'll take a right good will waught
For auld lang syne She doesn't know what she's done
Little one doesn't know when to stop
Love must find her
Love must find her a way
And she doesn't know what he's thinking
She only knows how he behaves
Love must find him
Love must find him a way
I reckon I must be just an old softy
Cause I still believe in love
Well I think the best is yet to come
Cause where I'm from is also where I'm going
And in the time that it takes to sing this song
I hope you can see for yourself
Love must find you
Love must find you a way
I reckon I must be just an old softy
Because I still believe in love
Well I think the best is yet to come
Cause where I'm from is also where I'm going
And in the time that it takes to sing you this song
I think I can see for myself
Love has found me
Love has found me a way
Oh, love has surely found a way
La la la la
Never did I feel like this before
Never was I so confused
I don't know if I'm up or down
I guess I've got nothing to lose
Never did I feel so good before
Guess I might as well hold onto a feeling
It feels so fine
As long as it's on my mind
What a blue Monday talk about lonely
Don't look back don't look down
Oh don't know how I made it through
I guess it's got something to do with you
Never was I so in love before
The world is like a collage
Yes, and the only thing I can see clearly
Is the slow steady glow of love in her eyes
Talking about the slow steady glow of love in her eyes
La la la la One, two, three
When I walk along your city streets and look into your eyes
When I see that simple sadness that upon your features lies
If my spirit starts to sink, it comes as no surprise
It's been a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to your town, this town
There's a pasture in the countryside I used to call my own
There's a natural pillow for my head, the grass there's overgrown
I think of that place from time to time when I want to be alone
It's been a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to your town, this town
Now people live from day to day, but they do not count the time
They don't see the days slipping by and neither do I
Now people live from day to day, but they do not count the time
They don't see the days slipping by and neither do I
When I walk along your city streets and look into your eyes
When I see that simple sadness that across your features lies
If my spirit starts to sink, it comes as no surprise
I've come a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to this town, your town In line, in line
It's all in line
My ducks are all in a row
They do not change
They do not move
They have nowhere to go
I've been talking to a friend of mine
Talking, talking
He says making money's just a waste of time
He's a lazy gent
He don't pay no rent
He's all bent out of shape from living in a tent
It's hard to hear what he has to say whoa
Cause everyone around me is just the same way
More, more, Daddy give me some
Give me some more, more
Daddy give me some more
Some kind of funny looking money machine it is I must say
Saddest looking people that I've ever seen
Living in a hole
Body and soul
Strung out on the company dole
One for a nickel and two for a dime
Every time
Time may be money
But your money won't buy time
In line, in line
It's all in a line
My ducks are all in a row
They do not shift
They do not move
They have nowhere to go
Me and my flea we were down by the water
Fell in a hole with Superman's daughter
Living alone
Chewing on a bone
Pretty as homemade sin
She had to be high by the look in her eye
Her hands were wet and her mouth was dry
The sun on the moon
The sun on the moon
The sun on the moon made a mighty nice light
The sun on the moon made a mighty nice light
Sun on the moon, my man
Bow wow wow wow, honk your horn, honk your horn
Bow wow wow wow, honk your horn
Bow wow wow wow, honk your horn, honk your horn
Bow wow wow wow, honk your horn
In line, in line
It's all in line
My ducks are all in a row
They do not change
They do not move
They have nowhere to go
Sometimes I'm hungry, I don't know what to do
What do I do?
You can take a taco to Katama, too
The sun on the moon
The sun on the moon
The sun on the moon, my man
The sun on the moon makes a mighty nice light
It's alright we leave it tonight
Bow wow wow wow, honk your horn, honk your horn Gosh almighty baby
Yes, indeed
You supply the satisfy
And I'll supply the need
I can't help the way I feel
Though I know just where it leads
You make it easy (yes, you do)
For a man to fall
For a man to fall
Now Heaven knows I love my woman
Just bound to fuss and fight
Now I wind up on the barroom stool
Buying drinks and keeping tight
You know that I've never done
What's come in my mind tonight
You make it easy
Just sitting there looking good
For a man to fall
For a man to fall
Now me and my wife
We've got the rest of our life
To make this thing right
But you and me will only see tonight
So baby, won't you turn me down
Point me out the door
I'll head home and sleep it off
Just like every time before
You keep on looking good my way
I won't hold out anymore
You make it easy, yeah
You sure do make it easy, babe
For a man to fall
For a man to fall
You don't have to make it so easy, baby, no, no, no, no
For a man to fall
For a man to fall
For another wise good man to fall
You don't have to make it so easy, baby
For another wise good man to fall
You don't have to make it so easy, baby no, no
You don't have to make it so easy
For a man to fall Summer's here, I'm for that
I got my rubber sandals, got my straw hat
I got my cold beer, I'm just glad that I'm here
Summer's here, that suits me fine
It may rain today 'cause I don't mind
It's my favorite time of the year and I'm glad that it's here
Old man wintertime, he goes so slow
It's ten degrees below, you know
You take your ice and snow
And let my balmy breezes blow
Yeah, the water's cold but I've been in
Baby, lose the laundry and jump on in
I mean all God's children got skin and it's summer again
Old man wintertime, he goes so slow
Ten degrees below, you know
You can take your ice and snow
But let my balmy breezes blow
Summer's here, I'm for that
I got my rubber sandals, got my straw hat
Drinking cold beer, man, I'm glad that I'm here
It's my favorite time of the year and I'm glad that it's here, yeah Christmas future is far away, Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today bringing joy that may last
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, may your heart be light
In a year our troubles will be out of sight
From now on, have yourself a merry little Christmas, make the yuletide gay
In a year our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days, happy golden days of yore
Precious friends who are dear to us gather near to us once more
I know that in a year we all will be together, if the Fates allow
Until then, we'll just have to muddle through somehow
And have ourselves a merry little Christmas now

Cause everybody knows I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun
For another overload
I hear you singing in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Well, he's still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the same, no
 
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Well, he's still on the line

Still on the line  Caroline, I see you
Standing on the stairway
Waiting for your bear there
Handy on the landing
Penny in my pocket
High enough to hold you

When I come back home to you tomorrow
You may well be angry
I'll for sure be hungry
Meet me in the middle
Make it melt like chocolate
Be my little baby

I take you down by the water
Some December morning
Take you from your family
Leave them with their longing
Take you by your hand
Somewhere on the sand

Caroline, I love you
Though I'm late to say so
Hesitate to tell you
What will be your answer?
Some December morning
Standing on the stairway
Caroline, I see you I forget what to ask for, there isn't anything I haven't been given
How could I wish for anything more as I am here living in heaven?
This moment in the sun to feel the wheel turning on

Carry me on my way, carry me on my way
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way

I worry about my actions, I think about the damage I do
I've seen the coming attractions, Armageddon and Waterloo
I tried to change my mind, I wasted precious time


Who knows where the time goes, only everything is everything
Feels like I'm wearing my father's clothes, singing a song my brother would sing
I turned to hide my face, they're gone without a trace Got to watchdog watching me, doggy, watching me packing my bags
He knows I'm leaving town, I can see that it's a drag
Why leave the life I love here in the great state of Maine
Just to ride that shining rail, just to size that ball and chain?

Oh, I got to spend just a little more time with you yeah, that's why
Got to spend just a little more time with you my girl, oh oh oh
Got to spend just a little more time with you baby, yes I do, yes I do
Oh, I got to spend just a little more time with you yeah, that's why

I passed on the cocaine, said bye-bye to my methadone
Put down the bottle for one more day, backing off of my tobacco Jones
Still feel like a hopeless junkie, like a man who can't say no
I look back and there's that monkey, rascal won't let go, let me go

Got to spend just a little more time with you, so help me now
Got to spend just a little more time with you my baby, oh, oh
Got to spend just a little more time with you, yes I do, yes I do, now
Got to spend just a little more time with you, oh oh oh

I get high and I can't come down, I get high just hanging around
I get high, I go lost and found, I get high oh I oh I

Got to spend just a little more time with you baby, I'll be walking in the light
Got to spend just a little bit more time with you, oh oh
Got to spend just a little more time with you, just a little more time, just a little more time
Got to spend just a little bit more time with you, oh oh Beneath the tide the fishes glide
Fin to fin and side to side
For fishy love has now begun
Fishy love, finny fun
Paper moon, paper heart
Pink balloon, work of art
Al Capone, Bugs Moran
Valentine's Day
Bootleg gin, porkpie hat
Dew Drop Inn, dirty rat
Through the heart, cupid's dart
Valentine's day
Oh day to repay the one that you love
Gentlemen take off your hats as I speak thereof
Just a brief break from the push and the shove
We may go a few rounds without boxing gloves
Land your punch, I stand my ground
We break for lunch and a second round
We set 'em up, we knock 'em down
Valentine's Day
Me and you, you and him
Him and her, us and them
We keep score, love as war
Valentine's Day
I lost my teeth, I lost my hair
I lost my mind, you don't care
Love is war, all is fair
On Valentine's Day The sky was light and the land all dark, the sun rose up over Central Park
I was walking home from work, Gaia
The petal sky and the rosy dawn, the world turning on the burning sun
Sacred wet green one we live on, Gaia
Run, run, run, run said the automobile and it ran, run for your life, take to your heels
Foolish school of fish on wheels, Gaia, Gaia
Turn away from your animal kind, try to leave your body just to live in your mind
Leave your cold cruel mother earth behind, Gaia
As if you were your own creation, as if you were the chosen nation
The world around you, just a rude and dangerous invasion, Gaia, Gaia, Gaia

Someone's got to stop us now, save us from us Gaia, no one's got to stop us now

We thought we ought to walk awhile, so we left that town in a single file
Up and up and up, mile after mile after mile
We reached the tree line and I dropped my pack
Sat down on my haunches and I looked back down over the mountain
Helpless and speechless and breathless, Gaia
Pray for the forest pray for the tree, pray for the fish in the deep blue sea
Pray for yourself and for God's sake, say one for me, poor wretched unbeliever

Someone's got to stop us now, save us from us Gaia, no one's got to stop us now Now, I love my baby and she's bound to love me some
Yes, I love my baby and she's bound to love me some
Now, she throws her arms around me just like a circle round the sun, yeah
I lay down last night, Lord, just to try to take my rest
Yes I lay down last night, Lord, I was tryin' to take my rest
But my thoughts they just kept wanderin' like them wild geese in the west, baby
Now I know that sunrise, sunrise it's gonna shine in my back yard someday
I said I know that sunrise, sunrise, sunrise it's gonna shine in my back yard someday, hey
And that wind's just bound to rise up gonna blow, blow all my blues away, yeah, hey, hey, hey, yeah
I love my baby and she's bound to love me some
Yes, I said I love my baby and she's bound to love me some
Now, she throws her arms around me just like a circle around the sun, yeah Watch my back and light my way (my travelling star, my travelling star)
Watch over all of those born St. Christopher's Day (old road dog, young runaway)
They hunger for home but they cannot stay
They wait by the door, they stand and they stare
They're already out of there, they're already out of there
My daddy used to ride the rails (so they say, so they say)
Soft as smoke and as tough as nails (Boxcar Jones, old walking man)
Coming back home was like going to jail
The sheets and the blankets and babies and all
No, he never did come back home, never that I recall

Never mind the wind, never mind the rain, never mind the road leading home again
Never asking why, never knowing when, every now and then, there he goes again

She had a cat and a dog named Blue (my travelling star, my travelling star)
A big old stove and a fireplace, too (old road dog, young runaway)
She told me loved me like it was true
I knew I should stay, I knew I would go
Run, run, run away. Run, run, run away, boy

Run before the wind, run before the rain, over yonder hill, just around the bend
Never knowing why, never knowing when, every now and then, there you go again

Tie me up and hold me down (oh, my traveling star)
Bury my feet down in the ground (oh, old road dog)
Claim my name from the lost and found and let me believe this is where I belong
Shame on me for sure for one more highway song
My travelling star, my travelling star Yesterday I was undone
Couldn't find the strength to carry on
Head was full of dangerous clouds
The wind has moved them on I shout out loud
I've been waiting much too long, too long
For a change to come – but now I'm strong
Summer whispers in my ear
The time has come to disappear
In the life lives the love
And it leads me back to you
Stay inside of the love
Let it help to lead you through
Repeat
The universal guiding light
Will guide you if it's day or even night
And when your darkest hour is at hand
Will take you to a distant land
In the life lives the love
And it leads me back to you
Stay inside of the love
Let it help to lead you through
Repeat
It always leads me back to you
Repeat
In the life lives the love
And it leads me back to you
Stay inside of the love
Let it help to lead you through Breaker number nine, big buddy, put your ears on me now
This trucker got to have a big line tonight
Come on sucker, come back Brother Trucker yeah
I keep seeing double unless I close one eye
And I've got to roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker
Sure nuff ashamed about the shape I'm in
Roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker, I'm back on my wheels again
Roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker, someone to love the truck driving man now
Roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker, I'm back on my wheels again
I'm a driving fool, I make my own rules
One part man and one part mule, one part fossil fuel
I got the heart of steel, I pull eighteen wheels
Mister Nine to Five in his Coupe de Ville
No, never know how it feels
To really roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker
Holding my own just the best as I can
Roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker, I'm back on my wheels again
Roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker, outward bound from South Bend
Roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker, I'm back on my wheels again
Moon over New Jersey, big state police here
Well, I'm in a hurry, could you let me go in peace?
I'm an independent, I don't make no Teamster dough
Cause the A.F.L. and the C.I.O. still don't own the road
And the only man telling me where to go is the man who owns my load
He says roll, roll, roll Brother Trucker
I say where and you say when
Roll, roll, roll, Brother Trucker, get back on your wheels again
Roll, roll, roll, Brother Trucker, turn the goddamn thing around and do it again
Roll, roll, roll, Brother Trucker, back on my wheels again
Fat bucket, I'm back on my wheels again
I am running out of whites
Goddam, dim them headlights now
Two hours sleep in the last two nights
But that won't be alright tonight
I am hot as a pistol, dry as a bone
I'm coming on home and I hope my bed's alone
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll Sounds of laughter, here comes sunshine
Smiling faces all around
They possess you, bless you, sunshine
Now you can never let them down
I say sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, is that a cloud across your smile
Or did you dream again last night?
It's best you rest inside a while
As blue doesn't seem to suit you right
Things ain't what they used to be
I say pain and rain, misery
Illness in the family
And sunshine means a lot to me
I say sunshine
But could it be sunshine is drifting with midnight
And lonely when everyone's gone?
Blue crystal spirits and gardens in moonlight
Leave weak, alone and bleak, all quiet and grey by dawn
Sunshine, sunshine rising too late to chase the cold
And failing to change the frost to dew
She's trading her mood of yellow gold
For frostbitten shades of silver-blue
Friends and lovers past and gone, Lord
And no one waiting further on
I'm running short of things to be
And sunshine means quite a lot to me
I say sunshine
Whoa sunshine Source of all we hope or dread, sheepdog, jackal, rattler, swan
We hunt your face and long to trust that your hid mouth will say again
Let there be light, a clear new day
But when we thirst in this dry night
We drink from hot wells poisoned with the blood of children
And when we strain to hear a steady homing beam
Our ears are balked by stifled moans
And howls of desolation from the throats of sisters, brother, wild men
Clawing at the gates for bread
Even our own feeble hands aim to seize the crown you wear
And work our private havoc through the known and unknown lands of space
Absolute in flame beyond us, seed and source of Dark and Day
Maker whom we beg to be our mother father comrade mate
Till our few atoms blow to dust or form again in wiser lives
Or find your face and hear our name in your calm voice the end of night if dark may end
Wellspring gold of dark and day, be here, be now He's got arms like legs, he's got hands on his feet
He's got a nose like a doughnut, he's got a tendency to overeat
He don't use tools or weapons, he don't eat meat
He likes to stick to the bushes, tends to avoid the street
But he rides my Eldorado, baby, when he comes to town
You know he's out there somewhere trying to track you down
Look up in the sky, mama, that's the one, yeah
See the mighty profile block the noonday sun
He comes from the heart of darkness a thousand miles from here
Now that's the land where they understand what a woman might like to hear
You know that he loves you, baby, for what you really are
His love is a-burning hot as a big old ten cent cigar
(Ape sounds)
Now most of y'all gave seen a gorilla in a cage at the local zoo
He mostly sits around contemplating all the things that he'd prefer to do
He dreams about the world outside from behind those bars of steel
And no one seems to understand about the heartache the man can feel
The people stop and stare but nobody seems to care
It don't seem right somehow, it just don't seem fair
No no no come on baby
He's still a gorilla
(Ape sounds) Like everyone she knows
She's holding out for true love
Waiting on an answer
Ready for a change
And everywhere she goes
She's just a little bit on the lookout
A day might mean tomorrow
Questions still remain
It's not that she's so sad
She always was a happy soul
But lately she gets to wonder to herself
What's the good of going on anymore?
I see her in her room
Sitting at the window
Wondering if she's pretty
Feeling just a little small tonight
She thinks of going home
Giving up on the city
Maybe moving back down to Mobile
It's not that far to fall
I know she won't see me
But I might just say anyhow
If I could be right there right now
As I myself was told
Hold tight to your heart's desire
Never ever let it go
Let nobody fool you
Into giving it up too soon
Tend your own fire
Lay low and be strong
Wait awhile (wait it out)
Wait it on out (wait it out)
It'll come along
I know she won't see me
But I might just say anyhow
If I could be right there right now
As I myself was told
Hold tight to your heart's desire
Never ever let it go (never let it go)
Let nobody fool you
Into giving it up too soon
Tend your own fire
Lay low and be strong
Wait it out (wait it out)
Wait it on out (wait it out)
Let it come along
Oh, wait awhile (wait awhile) What good is that happy lie?
All you wanted from the start was to cry, girl
It looks like another fall
Your friends they don't seem to help at all
Now, when you're feelin' kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man
It does you no good to pretend, child
You've made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like you lose again, my friend
So go on home and look up your rainy day man
Now rainy day man he don't like sunshine
He don't chase rainbows, he don't need good times, no
Grey days rolling, then you'll see him
I said empty feeling, Lord now you need him
All those noble thoughts, they don't belong
Can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just go call up your rainy day man
Now simple pleasures they all evade you
Store-bought treasures, Lord none can save you, no now
Look for signs to ease the pain
I said ask again, go on and pray for rain
It looks like another fall
Your friends they don't seem to help at all
Now, when you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man
All I'm askin' just to look up your rainy day man Ever since the days of old
Men would search for wealth untold
They'd dig for silver and for gold
And leave the empty holes
Way down south in the Everglades
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves
Eagles fly and the otters play in the land of the Seminole

Blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never going to blow again
Calling to you like a long lost friend
'Cause I know who you are
Blow, blow from the Okeechobee
Way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligator and the gar

Progress came and took it's toll
And in the name of flood control
They made their plans and they drained the land
And now the glades are going dry
Last time I walked in the swamp
I sat up on a Cypress stump
I listened close and I heard the ghost
Of Osceola cry
 

Blow Seminole  Oh, end this day, show me the ocean
When shall I see the sea?
May this day set me in motion
I ought to be on my way
We were there
We were sailing on the Terra Nova
Sailing for the setting sun
Sailing for the new horizon
May this day show me an ocean
I ought to be on my way
Ought to be on my way right now
Stepping on the boat with a lump in my throat
On my way right now
I got a letter from a dear friend of mine
The story of a spiritual awakening
She spoke of her love returning in kind
She let me know that she'd be waiting
And I should be on my way by now
Walking across the floor
Reaching for the door
On my way by now
But here I sit
Country fool that I am
My elbow on my knee
And my chin in my hand
My mind in the gutter
And my eye on the street
Holed up
In a cave of concrete
And I ought to be on my way right now
Packing my things
While the telephone rings
On my way right now
I miss my lovely mother
And I love my lonely father
I know I owe my brothers
One thing and another
I hear my sister singing
And I ought to be on my way right now
Moving across the land
With my heart in my hand
On my way by now
Ought to be on my way by now
Oh, end this day
Set me in motion
Ought to be on my way
Out to the west of Lambert's Cove
There's a sail out in the sun
And I'm on board though very small
I've come home to stop yearning
Burn off the haze around the shore
Turn off the crazy way I feel
I'll stay away from you no more
I've come home to stop yearning Well, the sun's not so hot in the sky today
And you know I can see summertime slipping on away
A few more geese are gone, a few more leaves turning red
But the grass is as soft as a feather in a featherbed

So I'll be king and you'll be queen, our kingdom's gonna be this little patch of green

Won't you lie down here right now in this September grass?
Won't you lie down with me now, September Grass

Oh, the memory is like the sweetest pain. Yeah, I kissed a girl at a football game
I can still smell the sweat and the grass stains
We walked home together, I was never the same

But that was a long time ago, and where is she now? I don't know

Won't you lie down here right now in this September grass?
Won't you lie down with me now, September grass

Oh, September grass is the sweetest kind, it goes down easy like apple wine
Hope you don't mind if I pour you some, made that much sweeter by the winter to come
Do you see those ants dancing on a blade of grass?
Do you know what I know? That's you and me, baby

We're so small and the world's so vast, we found each other down in the grass

Won't you lie down here right now in this September grass?
Won't you lie down with me now, September grass

Lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down

Won't you lie down here right now in this September grass?
Won't you lie down with me now, September grass
Won't you lie down here right now in this September grass?
Won't you lie down with me now, September grass Slipping away, what can I say
Won't you stay inside me, month of May?
And hold on to me golden days, slipping away
Sunshine on my wall
To keep my mind on the things I'm saying
Footsteps in the hall to tell me
I've been this way before, nevermore
Let it rain, sweet Mary Jane
Let it wash your love down all around me
Come inside and put it down, let it rain
I've been trying hard to find a way to let you know
That we can make it shine most all the time
This time round I'm searching down to where I used to go
And it's been on my mind to make it shine
You can say I wanna be free
I can say someday I will be
You can say I wanna be free
I can say someday I will be
When I catch a common cold I wanna hear a saxophone
When I let the good times roll, baby slide me a bass trombone
Walk me down old Funky Street Lord knows I feel good enough to eat now
Hold my soul now, I'm sure enough fond of my rock 'n roll
When I go to sleep at night wanna hear a slide guitar
When I'm feeling loose and right go riding in my automobile
Boney Maroney and Peggy Sue got the rocking pneumonia
Got the boogie woogie flu, hey
Hold my soul said I'm sure enough fond of my rock 'n roll, good God
Looky here, looky here, whoah
Go go now go
Woah I'll tell you about Machine Gun Kelly
He rode along the outlaw trail
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man
But the woman was as hard as hell

Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her run you round
Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, Machine Gun

I'll tell you about Katherine Kelly
Tired of being such small time, now
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son
Make it in the world of crime


You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly
Careful of what you do, now
If you keep listening to your old lady
Isn't no telling what'll happen to you, now
Machine Gun

The government boys they came for Machine Gun
Took the poor boy away
They stuck him in a hole in a Leavenworth prison
Where he lived until his dying day

Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her put you down
Don't let the woman make you out to be a clown, Machine Gun
Watch out, Machine Gun Oh Lord I feel fine today
Walking on cloud nine today
I'm over that line today
Happiness is finally mine today
I guess I'm just a lucky guy
And I'm prepared to tell you why
It's strictly on account of
My sweet potato pie
Ooh my ooh my
I'm the fellow that she loves the most
The main reason why she left the coast
She's my little girlziña
That much hotter that a jalapeño
Tender like a night in June
Sweeter than a honeymoon
Brighter than a silver spoon
Just as crazy as a loon
Softer than a lullaby
Deeper than the midnight sky
Soulful as a baby's cry
My sweet potato pie
I used to see her around the neighbourhood
I wonder how she grew up so good
She belonged to Freddy, he was bad
And I never was ready to make him mad
I'm glad I had to wait awhile
A little bit too juvenile
I needed to refine my style
A silk suit and a crocodile smile
So let the whole damn world go by
Cause I just want to testify
From now on it's me and
My sweet potato pie Well I'm-a going back down maybe one more time
Deep down home, October road
And I might like to see that little friend of mine
That I left behind once upon a time
Oh, promised land and me still standing
It's a test of time, it's a real good sign

Let the sun run down right behind the hill
I know how to stand there still
'Till the moon rise up behind the pine, oh Lord
October road
October road
October road

It's the big-time life that I can't abide
Raise my rent, tan my hide
Sweet call of the countryside
Go down slow, open wide
I did my time and it changed my mind
I'm satisfied, oh

(I got so)
I got so low down, fed up, my God, I could hardly move
(I could hardly move)
Won't you come on, my brother
Get on up
(Yeah)
And help me find my groove

Keep me walking, October road
Keep me walking in the sunshine, yeah
A little friend of mine
October road
Help me now
October road
Ohhohh Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox
I'm the one that's singin' this sad song
Well, I'll cry every time that you slip in one more dime
And let the boy sing the sad one one more time
Southern California, that's as blue as the boy can be
Blue as the deep blue sea, won't you listen to me now
I need your golden gated cities like a hole in the head
Just like a hole in the head, I'm free
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox
I'm the one that's singin' this sad song
Well, I'll cry every time that you slip in one more dime
And let the boy sing the sad one one more time
I do believe I'm headed home
Hey mister, can't you see that I'm as dry as a bone
I think I'll spend some time alone
Yes, unless you've found a way of squeezin' water from a stone
Let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can
Let the springtime begin, let the boy become a man
I done wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song
I done been this lonesome picker a little too long
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox
I'm the one that's singing this sad song
Well, I'll cry every time that you up and slippin' in one more dime
And let the boy sing the sad one one more time
Well I've been spreadin' myself thin these days, don't you know?
Goodbye! Take all the money that we need for school
And to keep the street people in out of the cold
Spend it on a weapon you can never use
Make the world an offer that they can't refuse
Open up the door and let the shark-men feed
Hoover of the future in the land of greed
Sell the Ponderosa to the Japanese
Slap leather
Head for that line of trees, yeah
Slap leather
Go on Ron, just about to go myself
Turn the whole wide world into a TV show
So it's just the same game wherever you go
You never meet a soul that you don't already know
One big advertisement for the status quo
As if these celebrities were your close friends
As if you knew how the story ends
As if you weren't sitting in a room alone
And there was somebody real at the other end of the phone, yeah
Squibnocket
Phone sex
Just about to dial your number
Get all worked up so we can go to war
We find something worth killing for
Tie a yellow ribbon around your eyes
Big McFalafel and a side of fries, yeah
Big McFalafel
Storming Norman
I just love a parade
Slap leather
Phone love
Big McFalafel
Just about to dial myself I like to think about the time I met you
Living with your people down in New Orleans
Mad at your mama 'cause she'd never let you
Ride in no nasty limousine
Later on the levee
With the moon up above
I lost my heart
And confessed my love
Now Lucy say, God have mercy
I've got to stop thinking about that, somehow
Does me no damn good
One summer night in a field of wheat
God's sweet lanterns up hanging in the sky
Moving light on your tiny feet
I knew I had to love you till the day I die
They talk about
Amazing Grace
It meant something
When I saw your face
Oh now Lucy say God have mercy
I've got to stop thinking about that
Oh Lucy say
Can't stop thinking about you
I think of all the little things
That I never told you
I think I may get to hold you someday
It's my brain just like a man possessed
I can't do me no work
I can't get me no rest
I can't understand it baby
Don't like to think about the way it ended
I hate remembering the things that I said
I dream a dream of a love so splendid
I wake up hard in an empty bed
I wonder who'll be
Loving you next
Some fool will be writing
Bad checks
Oh now Lucy, God have mercy
God, I've got to stop thinking about that, somehow
Lord have mercy
Got to stop thinking about that
Oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh you
Stop thinking about you, yeah When I feel as though my love is sinking down
The sun doesn't want to shine
And when it feels like she won't face another day
Life is unkind
She's frozen in time
And here comes another grey morning
A not so good morning after all
She says ""Well, what am I to do today
With too much time and so much sorrow""
She hears the baby waking up downstairs
She hears the foghorn calling out across the sound
Repetition in the morning air
Is just too much to bear
And no one seems to care
If another day goes creeping by empty and ashamed
Like an old unwanted memory that no one will claim
The clouds with their heads on the ground
She's gonna have to come down
She said ""Move me, move me
I'm locked up inside""
Well, I didn't understand her
Though God knows I tried
She said ""Make me angry
But just make me cry
But no more grey morning
I think I'd rather die"" Oh, baby
Don't you loose your lip on me no, no no
Lord, have mercy, baby, now now now
Don't you loose your lip on poor old loving man JT, no woah
Now, I've tried so hard to be your good boy
Good God almighty, don't you know, mama
Tell me what more, what more
In this world, in this whole wide world can one good boy
Just one by himself man be, no woah Ricky's been kicking the gong
Lickety-split, didn't take too long
A junkie's sick, a monkey's strong
That's what's wrong
Well, I guess he's been messing around downtown
So sad to see the man losing ground
Winding down behind closed doors
On all fours
Mama, don't you call him my name
He can't hear you anymore
Even if he seems the same to you
That's a stranger to your door
Go on, ask him what's he come here for
Oh my God, a monkey can move a man
Send him to hell and home again
An empty hand in the afternoon
Shooting for the moon
It's halfway sick and it's halfway stoned
He'd sure like to kick but he's too far gone
They wind him down with the methadone
He's all on his own
But baby, don't you throw your love away
I hate to seem unkind
It's only that I understand the man
That the monkey can leave behind
I used to think he was a friend of mine
Oh La la la la la la la la Wake up Suzy, put your shoes on, walk with me into this light, oh
Finally this morning, I'm feeling whole again, it was a hell of a night
Just to be with you by my side, just to have you near in my sight
Just to walk a while in this light, just to know that life goes on

Wake up Suzy, put your shoes on, walk with me into this light

Another night has gone, life goes on, another dawn is breaking
Turn and face the sun, one by one, the world outside is waking
Morning light has driven away all the shadows that hide your way
And night has given away to the promise of another day
Another day, another chance that we may finally find our way
Another day, the sun has begun to melt all our fears away
Another day, another day

Oh, wake up Suzy, put your shoes on, walk with me into this light Listen to me and I'll sing you a song
And the time will go by till you never know where it's gone
Talk to me and I'll tell you my life story
Walk with me and I'll tell you my dreams of glory
There we are walking hand in hand
Somewhere on the sand
At the end of the land
And the edge of the shining sea
Drifting through time and space on the face of a little blue ball Falling around the sun
One in a million, billion twinkling lights
Shining out for no one
In the middle of the night
Here we are
Sparks in the darkness
Speaking of our love
Burning down forever and forever
Oh, I don't know if I told you
But you hold my heart in your hand
And I found out something about you baby
Without you I'm a lonely man
So though I never say that i love you, I love you
Darling I do
Carly, I do love you
And though we are as nothing to the stars that shine above
You are my universe, you are my love
Here we are, like children forever
Taking care of one another
While the world goes on without us, all around us Oleana, via Del Norte, O Canada
It was snowtime, it was showtime, it was no time
To be lost in downtown Toronto
It was wintertime, ‘round dinnertime
I’m beginning to see that the sunshine just doesn’t want to
From a side street come a backbeat
Pulling on me like the moon pullin’ on the tide
Ay caramba, one-note samba, la la la la bamba
Lighting me up inside

They had the heat of the sun in the beat of the talking drum
The light of a tropical moon on a night to remember
Someone summoned up summer just strumming on an old guitar
And every note was the antidote to December

My first impression, some kind of procession
Pulling on a long line of fancy dancers
A band stuck up on a flatbed truck
They were raising a ruckus swinging for the fences
Exiled Mexican textile working
Punching two clocks, sending two paychecks home boys
Hard working law ‘biding bus riding people
Celebration on wheels destination unknown

They had the heat of the sun in the beat of the talking drum
The light of a tropical moon on a night to remember
Someone summoned up summer just strumming on an old guitar
And every note was the antidote to December

Rio Grande
Oleana
Via Del Norte
Oh Canada
There was a lifeline south in the song coming from her mouth
It swallowed me up and I followed it on downtown
In the light of dawn the message that life goes on
For the frozen man an invitation to live again

They had the heat of the sun in the beat of the talking drum
The light of a tropical moon on a night to remember
Someone summoned up summer just strumming on an old guitar
And every note was the antidote to December

They were shakin’ it loose with the juice from the mambo man
Long lanky Yankee boy, Buckwheat and Spanky my my

Whoa, Mud Slide, I'm depending on you
I don't know but I've been told
There's a time from time to time
I can't eat, I can't sleep
But I just might move my feet
Because there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music
To change a young lady's mind
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou
To leave the world behind, whoa
Mud Slide I'm depending upon you
Mister Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
I've been letting the time go by
Letting the time go by
Yes, I'm letting the time go by
Letting the time go by
I'm going to cash in my hand
And pick upon a piece of land
And build myself a cabin back in the woods
Lord, it's there I'm going to stay
Until there comes a day
When this old world starts to changing for the good
Now the reason I'm smiling
Is over on an island
On a hillside in the woods where I belong
I want to thank Jimmy, Jimmy, John, Nick and Laurie
The No Jets Construction
For setting me down a homestead on the farm, whoa, ooooo
Mud Slide, I'm depending upon you
Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
Night goes on and on, don't want to come at all
Baby, baby, baby, I know on a Haiti day
Stoney Lee Blue Borne picking on a fretless bass, yeah, yeah
Oil Slick slipping and a sliding and a slapping on
Kootcheroo! Ha ha ha, ha ha ha Sing a song for the wrong and the wicked
And the strong and the sick, as thick as thieves
For the faceless fear that was never so near
Too clear to misbelieve
Well the sea is jumping salty
And the porpoise has the blues
My recollection's faulty
And I cannot find my shoes
And my wiring is misfiring
Due to cigarettes and booze
I'm behind in my dues
I just now got the news
He seems to tell us lies
And still we will believe him
Then together he will lead us
Into darkness, my friends
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Man says: ''Stand to one side, son
We got to keep this big ball rolling
It's just a question of controlling
For whom the bell is tolling''
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
''There'll be suffering and starvation
In the streets, young man''
Just where have you been, old man?
Just look out of your window man
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Well, it isn't nobody's fault but our own
Still, at least we might could show the good sense
To know when we've been wrong
And it's already taken too long
So we bring it to a stop
Then we take it from the top
We let it settle on down softly
Like your gently falling snow
Or let it tumble down and topple
Like the temple long ago
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Keep hollerin' timber, timber, I hope it don't fall on me
I'm hollerin' timber, whoa, timber, let it all fall down
Go on, let it fall down, let it fall down let it all fall down together
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down It was just after sunrise and down by the sea
Down on the sand flats where nothing will grow
Come drumming and footsteps like out of a dream
Where the golden green waters come in
Just nine lucky soldiers had come through the night
Half of them wounded and barely alive
Just nine out of twenty was headed for home
With eleven sad stories to tell
I remember quite clearly when I got out of bed
I said, oh, good morning what a beautiful day Well the moon is in the ocean
And the stars are in the skies
And all that I can see
Is my sweet Maria's eyes
Sarah, Sarah Maria
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya
Well you know about the sugar cane
That comes from way down South
She's got one end in her hand
She's got one end in her mouth
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya
She took me out walking
To the corner of the world
Where everyone was a-talking
'Bout such a pretty little girl
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya
Well the moon is in the ocean
And the stars are in the skies
And all that I can see
Is my sweet Maria's eyes
Sarah, Sarah Maria
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya
Sarah, Sarah Maria
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya There are ladies in my life, lovely ladies in these lazy days
And though I never took a wife may I say that I have loved me one or two
Of the people in my past, fading faces in a waking dream
And though they never seemed to last very long
There are faces I remember from the places in my past
I said all the dead head miles and the insincere smiles
Sometimes I can laugh and cry and I can't remember why
But I still love those good times gone by, hold on to them close or let them go, oh no
I don't know, I just seem to sing these songs
And say I'm sorry for the friends I used to know Things may always stay the way they are
Still my head looks for a change from time to time
I don't really mean to look that far
Turn on the music
Strike up the music
Let the music change my mind
Now don't I dig the big time rock and roll
Sit in the darkness and be somebody else
A time which after all is under control
Crank out the music
Give me music
Let the music fill the air
My dear friend, your head's been sinking like a stone
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime
There's a symphony inside you
There's a thousand things for you to do, so come on
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so
What I hear in here is violins
Give me music
Miss the music
Let the music be there too
I'll never know what to do
Unless you let the music be there too
You see this man his head's been sinking like a stone
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime
There's a symphony inside you
There's a thousand things for you to do, so come on
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so
Well, you know, what I hear in here is violins
Strike up the music
Lay on the music
Let the music be there, too
La la la la
Let it be there, too
La la la la
Give me music
Let there be some music
All the music
Diggin' music
Yeah yeah yeah One morning, one morning, one morning in May
I spied a young couple, they were making their way
One was a maiden so bright and so fair
And the other was a soldier and a brave volunteer
''Good morning, good morning, good morning'' said he
''And where are you going my pretty lady?''
''I'm going out a-walking on the banks of the sea
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing''
Now they had not been standing but a minute or two
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune that he played made the valleys all ring
''Oh hark'', cried the maiden, ''hear the nightingale sing''
''Oh maiden, fair maiden, 'tis time to give o'er''
''Oh no, kind soldier, please play one tune more
For I'd rather hear your fiddle at the touch of one string
Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing
Oh soldier, kind soldier, will you marry me?''
''Oh no, pretty maiden that never shall be
I've a wife down in London and children twice three
Two wives and the army's too many for me
Well, I'll go back to London and I'll stay there for a year
It's often that I'll think of you, my little dear
And if ever I return it will be in the spring
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing
To see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing'' In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ
Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before
The ox and ass and camel which adore
Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart Now if all my golden moments could be rolled into one
They would shine just like the sun for a summer day
And after it was over, we could have it back again
With credit to the editor for striking out the rain very clean
And all it really needed was the proper point of view
No one's gonna bring me down
No one's gonna stop me now
Now I gathered up my sorrows and I sold them all for gold
And I gathered up the gold and I threw it all away
It all went for a good time and a song, come on
The laughter was like music, it did float my soul along for a while
And all it really needed was the proper point of view
No one's gonna reach me here
No one's gonna know I'm gone
You may think I might be crazy and I guess you must be right
But I know the way I feel today is out of sight
I do not trust my senses to remember your name
Without corrective lenses, things are never twice the same anyway
And all it really needed was the proper point of view
No one's gonna bring me down
And no one's gonna stop me now, no one
No one's gonna reach me here
No one's gonna know I'm gone Everybody knows that I'm just a Joe that likes to hang around
Talking about my problems, bringing other people down
Well this may be so, but not long ago, I was sitting on the top of the world
Sure is strange how things can turn themselves around
When I'm in need of a little bit of consultation, used to call on my Uncle John
I took a trip down to West Virginia, found him dead and gone
And as some sort of silly little consolation, they gave me my ticket back
What you're going to do with folks like that?
You can talk about bands of angels
And they think you come with your soul in your hands to set their children free
But you talk about little bit of understanding, things that happen day to day
Some of you folks sure enough have been good to me
You come on talkin' about angel bands
And they think you come with your soul in your hands to set their children free
But you talk about little bit of understanding, things that happen day to day
Someone has been good to me
Nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you
Nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you
Nobody but you, say nobody, nobody but you
And Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but you
Hey nobody, nobody Don't be sad 'cause your sun is down
You can rise above it
Don't be sad 'cause you're on your own
You have to learn to love it oh no
Don't be sad 'cause your sun is down
You're gonna find your way yeah yeah
Don't be sad 'cause your day is done
There's another day, everyday
Everyday I wake up just the same
Waiting for something new
Every night I have myself to blame
For the dreams that haven't come true
Especially today I'm feeling blue
Don't be sad 'cause your son is down
Little mama he's bound to feel it
Don't be sad 'cause your boy is blue
It wouldn't do to conceal it from you oh no
Don't be sad 'cause your sun is down
The night doesn't need your sorrow
Don't be sad 'cause the light is gone
Just keep your mind on tomorrow and carry on
Everyday I wake up just the same
Waiting for something new
Every night I find myself to blame
For the dreams that haven't come true
But especially today I'm feeling blue, feeling blue whoa Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow Who comes this night, this wintry night
As to the lowly manger?
The shepherds and the kings did come
To welcome in the stranger
Who sends this song upon the air
To ease the soul that's aching?
To still the cry of deep despair
And heal the heart that's breaking

Brother Joseph bring the light
Fast, the night is fading
And who will come this wintry night
To where the stranger's waiting?

Who comes this night, with humble heart
To give the fullest measure
A gift of purest love to bring
What good and worthy treasure

Brother Joseph bring the lamb
For they are asking for Him
The children come this starry night
To lay their hearts before Him

For those who would the stranger greet
Must lay their hearts before Him
And raise their song in voices sweet
To worship and adore Him



Pure of heart this starry night
To lay their hearts before Him Did you say I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A, B, C of it
Right down to the X, Y, Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

All the sky's a blackboard
High above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me tonight

All the sky's a blackboard
High above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

Mmm, one thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A, B, C of it Yonder mountain so high
I can't make it all on my own, no
Rolling river, why so wide?
To sweep me up and to bear me on
Up against the sky so bright
That I can't even close my eyes

I know I will follow
Follow love
Yes, yes, I will follow
Follow love
I will follow
Follow love
Follow love

Growing slowly like a tree
Someday soon, darling, I love you, I love you
Soft and gentle full summer moon
Set my soul free
Thank you, baby
Drifting like a cloud in the sky
I can see myself from high above

I know I must follow
Follow love
Somehow I will
Follow love
I must follow
Follow love
Follow love

Oh, half the future and half the past
They're waiting inside your eyes
Yes, and after all of this, to last and last
'Til at last it's your time to rise, rise

True believer that I am
I am blind, lead me on, lead me on
Blessed receiver of your love
I own my own time and I've been holding on, holding on
Leave the word unspoken
And the spell will not be broken

And I'm bound to follow now
Follow love
I know I must go
Follow love
I must follow
Follow love
Yes, I must follow
Follow love
Someone to hold my hand
Follow love
And somebody to lead me on, lead on (Follow love)
Somebody to walk beside me, oh
Follow love
Someone to follow me now (Follow love)
I must follow love (Follow love)
I will fall in love
I will follow love (Follow love)
Anywhere it leads me
I will follow love (Follow love)
Follow love Father, let us build a boat and sail away
There's nothing for you here
And brother, let us throw our lot out upon the sea
It's been done before
I'm thinking about a broken heart
I'm talking 'bout the break of dawn
You love me while I'm here
And you can miss me when I'm gone
Sweet misunderstanding
Won't you leave a poor boy alone
I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed
In the belly of a rolling stone
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
I had a little woman in Memphis
She wanted to be my bride
She said: ''Settle on down, traveling man
You can stay right by my side''
I tried so hard to please her
But I couldn't hold out too long
'Cause one Saturday night I was laying in bed
And I heard that highway song
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
Now one of these days that highway song
Will lose its appeal to me
I'm going to settle on down
Like a natural born man
I'm going to live my life naturally (free and easy, mmm)
Until that day the thunder's going to roll
And I notice there's a sign of rain
So I grab my bags and I pack my clothes
And I'm back on the road again
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
I'm thinking about a broken heart
I'm talking 'bout the break of dawn
You love me while I'm here
And you can miss me when I'm gone
And I said ''Sweet misunderstanding
Won't you leave a poor boy alone''
I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed
In the belly of a rolling stone
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
Here I am again, Holiday Inn
Same old four walls again
Gee, but it's fine to be back home again, whoa, now
Said, Holiday Inn, I'm on the road again Shall I tell it again how we started as friends
Who would run into one another now and again
At the Yippee Cai O or the Mesa Dupree, or a dozen different everyday places to be
I was living alone, we were ever so brave on the telephone
Would you care to come down for fireworks time
We could each just reach, we step out of line

And the smell of the smoke and the lay of the land
And the feeling of finding one's heart in one's hand
And the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing ""love must stand,""
Love forever and ever must stand

Unbelievable you, impossible me, the fool who fell out of the family tree
The fellow that found the philosopher's stone, deep underground like a dinosaur bone
Who fell into you at a quarter to two with a tear in your eye for the Fourth of July
For the patriots and the minutemen and the things you believe they believed in then
Such as freedom, and freedom's land and the kingdom of God and the rights of man
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing ""love must stand,""
Love forever and ever must stand and forever must stand

Oh, the smell of the smoke as we lay on the land
And the feeling of finding my heart in my hand
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing ""love must stand,""
Love forever and ever must stand and forever must stand

All on the Fourth of July, on the Fourth of July Somehow the season always brings a picture of you, baby boom baby
Holding on for everything you figured you're due, little turtleneck girl
The moon on your shoulder, the wind in your lovely hair, oh what a night
We sat on the beach and watched as the sun rose into the summer air
You said we couldn't miss what we never knew
Something 'bout something that you had to do
Sitting on the sand with a hole in my shoe
I had no way of knowing where you might have been, time goes by
All on my own I imagine you a life in between, all on my own
Wrote a long letter but it never made it out of my head, oh no
Somehow reading your name it wasn't the same as leaving the thing unsaid
How come I miss what I never knew
Drag out the past just to paint it blue
And spend my days with a dream of you?
Oh, after the fall
Here I'm trying to find our name on the wall
It was neither yours nor mine
It was something of the two combined
From a time spent out of time
I work hard to see that you remember my name, nod your head yes
Do all I can to make you wanna see me again, oh what a night
Got a letter from the mail, got a message from the telephone
Seems you're working in town, moving around, living alone
Now I'm caught in the spotlight, walking the wire
My feet are frozen and my heart's on fire
What do I do if my dream come true?
La la la la la
La la la la la Do believe I'm going to clap my hands
Think I might tap my feet
Put together a one-man band
Take a walkin' on down the street
Have a one-man parade
Nobody needs to know
Because I'm right good in holding on to secrets
And don't believe they show
All I want is a little dog
To be walking at my right hand
Taking a breeze just as free as you please
Maybe checking out occasional garbage cans
Talking bout a one man dog, you all
Nobody's friend but mine
Hey now, you can say that he's looking kind of funky
But I do believe he suits me just fine
We were on the road again
I was wondering what to do
Ah but Honalei, it was pouring down rain
Baby she had the low down blues
Hey now, I was looking for my walking cane
Tying on my highway shoes
Thinking 'bout a one man parade, you all
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey
I'm right good at holding on
Holding on, holding on
(Honalei, it's raining, Honalei)
Sure enough (It's raining, Honalei)
It's raining, better hear (It's raining, Honalei)
Hear rain, buckets (It's raining, Honalei)
Road is covered, muddy water (It's raining, Honalei)
Talking about a one man parade, you all
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey
I'm right good at holding on
Holding on, holding on
La la la la If I could go down now
While the whole town is sleeping
See the sun creeping up
On the hill yeah
I know the river and the railroad
Would run through the valley still
I guess it never was much to look at
Just a one-horse town
The kind of place young people
Want to leave today
Store fronts pretty much boarded up
Main Street pretty much closed down
Oh the church bell still rings on Sunday
Old folks still go
The young ones listen on the radio
Saturday night
Nothing but a stray dog
Running wild like nobody's child
And little by little, light after light, that's how it died
They say you never go home again, that's no lie
Its like a letter in the mail to a brother in jail
It's a matter of time
Until you can do a little bit better time
Doesn't it good to believe sometimes?
It used to be part of the heartland
Awful proud and strong
But deep, deep down
Peaceful and serene
When people used to talk about the country
That's what they used to mean
I might go down come the weekend
Go on my own
Drop off Annie and the baby
Maybe drive alone
Pay my last respects to a time
That has all but gone
We said, Mama come look at the mountain
The fire in the sky
It's lit up like the Fourth of July
The mill burning down
The jobs leaving town
The trains rolling by
And little by little, light after light, that's how it died
They say you never go home again, now that's no lie
Its like a letter in the mail to a brother in jail
It's a matter of time
Until you can do a little bit better time no no no Well, I've been lying in this dungeon since I was eighteen
Ten lonely years of my life taken
I've been living in the pages of a magazine
It breaks my heart to awaken

Set me free, sleep come free me
Set me free, set me free

Now the state of Alabama says I killed a man
The jury reached the same conclusion
I remember I was there, hell, with a tire iron in my hand
The rest is all confusion

Set me free, sleep come free me
Please, please, please
Set me free, set me free

More like an animal and less like a man
What they leave you ain't worth keeping
Brother let me tell you, I got a clock with no hands
The only way out is through sleeping

Set me free, sleep come free me
Please, please, please
Set me free, set me free now

You get to where you used to be, whoever you claim
It's open to interpretation
Just remember your number and abandon your name
And hold on to your imagination oh no no

Set me free, sleep come free me
Please, please, please, please
Set me free, set me free
Set me free Off the coast of Africa, bound for South America
A world away from here
Is a ship that sails the sea, is a man who's just like me
And I wish that I was there
I'm a lonely lighthouse, not a ship out in the night
I'm watching the sea
She's come halfway round the world to see the light
And to stay away from me
There is a shipwreck lying at my feet
Some weary refugee from the rolling deep
Ah, could you lose it all and fall for me?
Couldn't we shine?
I'm rolling all my golden moments into one
Like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
Like to shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night
Flashing on, flashing, fading away
Well if you feel lost and lonelyand don't know where to go
And you hear this song on the radio
Or even if you're feeling healthy and strong
You might like to sing along
But just because I might be standing here
That don't mean I won't be wrong this time
You could follow me and lose your mind
Couldn't we shine?
Rolling all my golden moments into one
Like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
Like to shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night
Flashing on, flashing, fading away
Off the coast of Africa, bound for South America
A world away from here
Is a ship that sails the sea, is a man who's just like me
And I wish that I was there yeah yeah yeah
I'd like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
Shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night
See me flashing on, flashing, fading away
Couldn't we shine just one more time
I'd like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
I'd like to shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night
Flashing on, flashing on, fading away That limousine
In which you made the scene
Suits you to a 't'
If all that you want to be
Is somebody that don't never walk nothin'
That big château
Where you wanna go
In the south of France
Going to end our big romance
Don't you do it
Honey, don't leave L.A
That Riviera is so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait
They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez
That I say baby don't you leave L.A
I heard it said
That you had it made
With your movie star
But, oh how right you are
If that's really 'bout the best you can, do bitch, come on
You moved my soul
So I played the role
Of your back door man
Yes and now I can't really complain
'Cause I love you
Honey, don't leave L.A
That Riviera is so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait, begging baby
They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez, très Beauvais
Baby don't leave L.A
No, no, no, no, no
Mama, don't you drop out of sight on me, now, no
That Riviera so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait
C'est vrai, baby
They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez
But I mean
Mama, don't you leave
Baby, don't you leave L.A., no This land is a lovely green, it reminds me of my own home
Such children I've seldom seen, even in my own home
The sky is so bright and clean, just like my home
Kind people as have ever been, won't you take me back to my own home?

Jump up behind me, my love, jump up behind me
Old Dan can bear us both, jump up behind me
We follow this road until we reach the sea, jump up behind me
We'll catch the tide and set Dan free, jump up behind me

I've been in this world awhile and I've seen a lot of country
Many days and many miles, all various and sundry
I've had my way and I've had my fun and I've had my chance to run free
Burning hot beneath the sun, freezing cold and wintry

Jump up behind me, my love, jump up behind me
Old Danny can carry us both, jump up behind me
We follow this road untill we reach the sea, jump up behind me
We'll catch the tide and set old Dan free, jump up behind me

I know now, only one thing matters in these day
One thing, true love, love and love alone, true love
Came out of a dream last night, thought I was back in my old home
Mom and Dad were both still alive and the babies not yet born, no
Felt like a festival and it felt like a Christmas morning
Felt the darkness fall away even as the world was turning on
I mean even as the world was turning on. La la la la la, la la la la. I say
Jump up behind me, my love, jump up behind me
Follow the road to the western sea She's been holding on too long
Hoping I'm going to change
Giving it up just a little bit more each time I come home
Looking and acting strange
Putting her down for putting up with me

B.S.U.R. Be as you are
S.U.C. As you see
S.I.M.I.M. As I am, I am

Do you think you might improve me
Trying to take control?
Watching every little thing I do
Just like a bleeding movie, just like a leading role?
Mama, this ain't me and I don't believe that's you


First you make believe
I believe the things that you make believe
And I'm bound to let you down
Then it's I who have been deceiving
Purposely misleading and all along you believed in me

So we circle around one another
Playing I guessing game, strangers at this masquerade
Pretending to know each other
We strain to catch a name
And never see the mistakes we must have made Where I've been, you don't know
And what I've got, baby, don't show
Now I won't try to teach you how
Don't talk now hmmm hmmm
Don't talk roads, don't talk sand
Don't talk dust, don't talk no man
Don't talk rules, don't talk vows
Don't talk now
I don't wanna hear the same old song
And too many rights still make a wrong, baby
I know she can't hurt me less by talking more, no
She can't make good what was bad before
No, it's too late now for me to lie
And I can't make a second try
I just came on back, babe, got to say goodbye, goodbye
Don't talk now hmmm hmmm
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Don't talk now Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Little darling
It's been a long cold, lonely winter
Little darling
It's been like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Little darling
The smiles are returning to their faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
Sun, sun, sun, sun
Here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, sun
Here it comes
Oh sun, sun, sun, sun
Here it comes
Mmmm (here it comes)
Little darling
I feel the ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
End In a world like today
It's rare to see young mothers like the ones
Who were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory to quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated to those of us
Who cherish that memory
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, boy, hurry to Sunday school
Filled with her load of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?
We love you, Sadie
There's no one above you, sweet Sadie

Well, well, well
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
No money will turn your life around
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas old brandy
Always that needed smile, once in awhile
She would break down and cry
Some times she'd seem so happy, yeah, yeah
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times, breaking the binds
With just a simple song


Ever since the beginning
It's her her love that was always winning, oh
Sadie, baby, Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?


If there's a heaven up above
I know that she's teaching angels how to love
Sadie, mama, mama, mama, Sadie


Isn't it funny that in the end
It's just the love that you gave us, oh Sadie
It's a mean world without you, yeah
Don't you know we love you, Sweet Sadie


Sometimes I'm feeling so all alone
But I know I've to carry on
It's a mean world without you
But I know I got to go on
It's what you wanted for me
Living in the past, sweet Sadie

Oh, Sadie
I love u mama sweet Sadie
I can't forget your love
Living in the past Just a-knockin' 'round the zoo
On a Thursday afternoon
There's bars on all the windows
And they're countin' up the spoons, babe
And if I'm feelin' edgy
There's a chick who's paid to be my slave, yeah, oh watch out James
But she'll hit me with a needle
If she thinks I'm tryin' to misbehave yeah
Now the keeper's tryin' to cool me
Says I'm bound to be all right
But I know that he can't fool me
'Cause I'm puttin' him uptight, yeah
And I can feel him gettin' edgy
Every time I make a sudden move, whoa whoa, yes it's true
And I can hear them celebratin'
Every time I up and leave the room
My friends all come to see me
They point at me and stare
Said, ""He's just like the rest of us
So what's he doin' there?""
Now they hide in their movie theaters
Drinkin' juice, keepin' tight, watch that bright light, Bishop
They're certain about one thing, babe
That zoo's no place to spend the night, no no
Just a-knockin' 'round the zoo
On a Thursday afternoon
Say there's bars on all the windows
And they're countin' up the spoons, yeah
And if I'm feelin' edgy
There's a chick who's paid to be my slave, yeah watch out Kootch
But she'll hit me with a needle
If she thinks I'm tryin' to misbehave Chorus:
’Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more
Verses:
Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times come again no more
(chorus)
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times come again no more
(chorus)
There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart whose better days are o’er
Though her voice would be merry, ’tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times come again no more
(chorus)
’Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
’Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
’Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
Oh, hard times come again no more Paris's rooftops were lovely to see
Switzerland's vertical landscape crossed my mind's eye just now
Canada's shoreline has been calling out to me
But it's been too long a time
Since last I crossed that vast Nantucket sound
Hello old friend, welcome me home again
Well, I've been away but that's all over now now
Say I can stay for October, now
Stay a while and play
Little dog David, I must look like a fool
I should've remembered you'd be forgetting my smell, well
Give me a week or two so recapture my cool
I've got stories to tell
About how I snatched the devil's catch and outran the hounds of hell
Hello old friend, welcome me home again
Well, I've been away but that's all over now now
Say I can stay for October, now
Stay a while and see
Hello old friend, welcome me home again
I know I've been away but that's all over now now
Isn't it nice to be home again?
Over here it's clear
Hello friend ""Je t'aime encore"" means ""I love you still""
""C'est pour toujours"" means ""I always will"" (always will)
""Tu me manquais trop"" means ""I missed you too much"" (yeah yeah)
""Je fait ce qu'il faut"" means ""I'll do what I must""
""Me voici a ta fenetre tous les gens me voient ici"":
""Here I am at your window darling for all your people to see me""
Ananas

Ananas
Laisse moi une fois laisse moi te voir, let me one more time, Ananas
Ananas, I'm loping along, hoping you're home, open up and let me on in

Maybe I rise and maybe I fall, yeah
Maybe you lie underneath it all
Sure, I ain't got nothing but for what you see (oh baby)
Even my own heart don't belong to me

Rough on the outside
Walking along, thinking about you
Walking along, thinking about you, ananas
Walking along, thinking about you
Walking along, thinking about you, ananas We are ridin' on a railroad
Singin' someone else's song
Forever standin' by that crossroad
Take a side and step along
We are sailin' away on a river to the sea
Maybe you and me can meet again
We are ridin' on a railroad
Singin' someone else's song, sing along
Time to time, I tire of the life that I've been leadin'
Town to town, day by day
There's a man up here
He claims to have his hands upon the reins
There are chains upon his hands and he's ridin' upon a train
Oh Lord, we been ridin' on a railroad
Singin' someone else's song
Forever standin' by that crossroad
Take a side and step along
We are sailin' away on a river to the sea
Maybe you and me can meet again now
We been ridin', we been a-ridin' upon a railroad
Singin' someone else's song  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Snooping around my door

You can wag your tail
Ain't going to feed you no more

When they said that you was high classed
Baby, I could see through that
Well, they said that you was high classed dog
But I can see through that, yeah
Baby, I know you ain't no real cool cat
 
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Snooping around my door

You can wag your tail
Ain't going to feed you no more

You know you made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You know you made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You ain't looking for a man
You're just looking for a home, babe
 
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Snooping around my door

You can wag your tail
Ain't going to feed you no more

Hey, hey (Hound, hound dog) 
Ain't going to feed you no more You've got to be taught, to hate and fear
You've got to be taught from year to year
It's got to be drummed in your dear little ear
You've got to be carefully taught
You've got to be taught, to be afraid
Of people whose eyes are oddly made
And people whose skin is a different shade
You've got to be carefully taught
You've got to be taught, before it's too late
Before you are six or seven or eight
To hate all the people your relatives hate
You've got to be carefully taught
You've got to be carefully taught Late last night so far away
I dreamed myself a dream
Well, I dreamed I as so all alone
Isn't it nice to be home again?
I said welcome home
Didn't we miss your smiling face?
Well the sun was nice in L.A., sunshine
Isn't it nice to be home again?
Well I said isn't it nice to be home again? (Spoken) When are people are going to see that nothing ain't never going to change until somebody finally makes up his mind and stands up and fights? Damn!
Lonely hearted hunter don't say nothing
The hunger and the hurt got only one law
Never mind your words
Unseen, unheard, unsung, undone
Ain't but one place left to run
Stand up now now, stand and fight
Stand up, stand and fight
Undercover creature that don't see sunshine
Make it in the dark, don't think twice
Never mind making nice
Black eyes, black sights, black magical rites tonight
There comes a time, babe
To stand and fight, stand up, stand and fight
Stand up, stand and fight
Don't you worry about me little darling
No, I ain't breaking
I'm shaking and aching
Because I can't stand waiting
There comes a time to stand and fight
Maximum destruction
Bloodred deadheads
Tearing it up, wearing it down
Never mind my name
I'm unclaimed, unnamed and unashamed
I'd like to say
Fan the flames, stand and
To stand up, stand and fight whoa
Stand up, stand and fight, look out
You ain't doing nobody no kind of favors (stand up, stand and fight)
Lying around like a rug on the floor (stand up, stand and fight)
Sooner or later you've got to stand up (stand up, stand and fight)
And say you won't take it any more (stand up, stand and fight)
Stand up, stand and fight
Stand up, stand and fight, no no no
Stand up, stand and fight, no no no
Stand up, stand and fight, whoa
The last time now: Stand up, stand and fight There are rifles buried in the countryside for the rising of the moon
May they lie there long forgotten till they rust away into the ground
Who will bend this ancient hatred, will the killing to an end?
Who will swallow long injustice, take the devil for a country man?
Who will say ""this far no further, oh lord, if I die today?""
Send no weapons no more money. Send no vengeance across the seas
Just the blessing of forgiveness for my new countryman and me
Missing brothers, martyred fellows, silent children in the ground
Could we but hear them could they not tell us ""Time to lay God's rifle down.""
Who will say, ""this far, no further,"" oh Lord, if I die today? Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
And it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in the penny arcade
It's Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in the penny arcade
It's Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
Paper moon ... Make my bed out of Wonder Bread
Spread some mustard upon my head
I don't want no onions or sauerkraut, mama
Hold on to the bun, baby, work it on out
I'm a chili dog
I guess you guessed by now, babe
Sure enough, I'm a chili dog
Look at me, delicious
Don't get jealous
Better not up and get overzealous
Watch out now you all
Come on now fella
Pass me down the relish
Don't read no Ann Landers
Just don't feed me no Colonel Sanders
I am not trying to fool you's
Don't bring home no Orange Julius
Got to havin' one more time
Get on down again, woh, woh, chili dog baby
Yes indeed, I want a chili dog, yeah
Talking about stone delicious, good for you too When I was just a child
My life was, oh, so simple
And the ways of the great world seemed strange and funny
Then when I was a young man
I learned of that machine
That turns out all those bales of precious money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Money money machine
Now you can measure you manhood by it
You can get your children to try it
You can bring your enemies to their knees
With the possible exception of the North Vietnamese
You take a strong hit from the money machine
Sitting on top, on top of the world
Strong hit from the money machine
Sitting on top, on top of the world
Oh, General Motors and IBM
AFL-CIO and all the King's Men
When I began the game
See me singing about the fire and rain
Let me just say it again
I've seen fives and I've seen tens
It was a strong hit from the money machine
Sitting on top, on top of the world
Strong hit baby from that money machine
Sitting on top, on top of the world
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Ha ha ha
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
(Money)
Give me that dough (Money, money, money)
Give me that dough (Money, money, money)
Give me that dough (Money, money, money)
Give me that dough (Money, money, money)
Been living in the lap of luxury too long
Please, Mr. DJ, won't you play my song
Maybe my baby will listen on the radio
Come back home to me
Help me spend my dough
I need a strong hit from the money machine please
Sitting on top, on top of the goddam world
I need a strong hit from that money machine baby
Sitting on top, on top of the world
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
From that money machine
Yeah yeah
Ha ha ha yeah
La la la la Watch your head on that root
Got to let your eyes adjust
I'm sorry about your suit
Can't do nothing about the dust
Welcome down underground
Hunker down a spell
Gets to feel like home to me
Though I know it looks like hell
Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love
And the world above
Mean nothing to the mole
Don't mean nothing to the mole
Never gets real hot down here
Fifty five degrees
It's always a little bit damp I fear
But I've never seem to freeze
Mushrooms and earthworms
Fancy stuff to eat
A world of quiet contemplation oh yes
Just below the street
Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love
And the world above
It's all nothing to the mole
I'm in a hole
Since I lost my baby
Living in a hole
Since I lost my girl
Would you play in the moonlight
Would you dance in the dirt
Come home way past daybreak oh yes
Cockleburs all stuck in your shirt?
Come back home to twilight
Come back home to me
Subterranean river you are
Meets the Molten Sea
Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love
And the world above
It's all nothing to the mole
Down in the hole yeah
Light and love
And the world above
Got nothing for the mole
It ain't got nothing for the mole
Look out for that, look out for that, look out for that root
For that root
Welcome down underground
Welcome
They're just doing what they're supposed to
To stay alive
Papilloma
Gotta do something about this dust, huh Hearts were exploding around us as we drifted south down the bay
The gray up above and gray down below left us with nothing to say
So we drifted along in silence till the tickle of life trickled in
And the rhythm began in the hiss of the sand, we were catching fire again

Oh boatman, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea
Oh boatman, taker and giver, can you deliver me? I would forever run free

Yeah, we finally caught up with legends, we were walking along side by side
We worked out a plan to go out hand in hand, the long trail just wasn't that wide
The water around us was freezing, we just laughed and threw ourselves in
And although we were old, the sting of that cold pumped up the feeling, here it is again

Oh boatman, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea
Oh boatman, taker and giver, can you deliver me? I would forever run free

Oh, I'm a message in a bottle drifting along on a deep blue sea
Waiting for some foreign shore, ready for something to be
No longer afraid of falling, we cut the strings to the sky
We found lever ground and we put ourselves down, amazing we all didn't die
We took each moment as given, by second they came
The ice and the sun and the thundering guns, good God I was finally sane

Oh boatman, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea
Oh boatman, taker and giver, can you deliver me?
Oh holy roller, I am the river, I am the mountain and the sea
Oh boatman, taker and giver, can you deliver me? I would forever run free Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows some holy
And some mistletoe
And they help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to one hundred-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to one hundred-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you Oh money, oh money, oh where have you gone?
I need me some money to have me some fun
Got to pick up my guitar and write me some hits
Build me some houses and blow them to bits
Got to furnish them boldly with style and with taste
Generate truckloads of solid waste

Hangnail, hangnail, hangnail, hangnail
Have you ever seen a man with a hangnail?
Hangnail, hangnail, hangnail

Oh money, oh money, oh where have you gone? It's written in the surface of her skin
There's been a baby there given away in love
I see it in the little lines around her eyes, across her brow
She'll be drifting away from me now
She'll shape all the feeling that's not quite there inside my soul
Love has gone away now, leaving behind an empty hole
And who am I to try to compete with the din
As the silence so easily rushes in?
I will fly away
It was something that I only dreamed of
Something that I'm not quite sure of
Something that I'll never tell you about Me and T-Bone on the road to town
It's like I'm walking with a talking machine
Just as soon as he thinks of something else
He won't wait to interrupt himself
Must be something that he can't quite say
He just doesn't want to leave it that  way
Although he may not know it yet
Unless I miss my bet
He's just trying to forget
What his heart remembers
I see that T-Bone got an automobile
Low-loping and open to the sky
All night behind the hurricane wheel
Riding in the eye
All day underneath the hood
Mondo Bondo, plastic, wood
He needs a mile of masking tape
If he wants to keep his ship in shape
Someday to escape
What his heart remembers
Oh yes, what his heart remembers
T-Bone's not alone, not alone
Looks like he gets a second chance
It's Mamarama and Lumalamalu
Want to take him to recovery dance
He's looking like he gets his meatsuit back
I guess he must have missed the crack attack
Still he's riding for a fall
'Cause it's written upon the wall
Now he must recall
What his heart remembers
What his heart remembers yeah now Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
You dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're going I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
It’s waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon River and me So much for your moment of prayer, God's not at home there is no there, there
Lost in the stars, that's what you are, left here on your own
You can only hope to live on this earth, this here is it, for all it's worth
Nothing else awaits you, no second birth, no starry crown
For an unbeliever like you, there's not much they can do that would turn you away
Though I hate to see you surrender, you need to surrender, we must find you a way to

Look up from your life, up from your life, look on up from your life, look up from your life

There's a river running under your feet, under this house, under this street
Straight from the heart, ancient and sweet, on its way back home
Even in the middle of your sadness, the everyday madness, the ongoing game
Even when you can't find a reason, still there is a reason, you don't need to name it

Look on up, look up from your life, look on up from your life, look up from your life

Oh, even for a minute to find yourself in it, to wait by the stream to drop out of your dream

Look on up, look up from your life, look on up from your life, look up from your life
Look up from your life, up from your life, look on up from your life, look up from your life It seems you've been living on your own
Lonely and free
Looking to make yourself known
Same as me

Well I see you in the public eyes
I see you're looking fine
The boy would be a businessman
And he signs the bottom line

Singing: ""Company man
Do what you can with my name
Rock and roll man, here I am
I'm staking my claim to fame""

He's got the smiling face of a friend
Still you're not quite certain you know him
The smile turns into a grin
What do you owe him?
You know you owe him

So if there's something you do well
Something you're proud of
Better to save some for yourself
If that's allowed

The crowd will never know you
You'll hardly know yourself
They'll turn you round and blow you up
Until you think you're someone else

''Company man
Do what you can with my name
Rock and roll man, here I am
I'm staking my claim to fame''

He can turn your time to gold
You better make as much as you can my friend
Because his money will turn you old
And they need a young man
The job takes a young man

Oh Company man oh
My Rock and roll man oh
Company man
Rock and roll man
You can shuck and jive for me
And I - yeah oh Need a reason to be here
Hoping to find it tonight
Walking alone on Broadway
Watching the people
Watching the town go down
Broadway's a river to me
Fat fish in the big city sea
Taxi cabs, limousines, submarines
Got my mind on a sweet dream
Keeping an eye on this street scene
Cause I'm open for love in the middle of town tonight
Had my fill of self-pity
I brought all my blues to the city
Guess I'm pressing my luck in the middle of town tonight
See me waiting on you to smile back on me, child
It looks like tomorrow
It seems like the end of a dream
Dawning on me on Broadway
In the morning light it's a dream
I'm just a fool looking for love on Broadway Me and my guitar always in the same mood
I am mostly flesh and bones and he is mostly wood
Never does grow impatient for the changes I don't know, no
If he can't go to heaven, maybe, I don't want to go, Lord
Picture me in the key of E, call me Uncle John
Any fool can easily see that we go back a long time
Feel something like fine to me, there's no such thing as the wrong time
He hops up on my knee, singing: ''Get down, Pops, it's song time''
Every now and then I'm a lonely man
It's nice to know that I've got a Friend
Puts his power right in my hand
All I've got to do is the best I can, if I can
I got a dog named David, I got a bird named Dinah
I got a birthmark on my thigh in the shape of Mainland China
Got a somewhat southern accent 'cause I come from Carolina
And if you want to find us, we'll be walking right behind you
I hear horns, I hear voices, I hear strings
Seems I was born with too many choices
Now what am I going to do with all these extra things
As they serve to confuse me, really
It's me and my guitar
Essentially me and my guitar
Oh, maybe a few friends fall by for tea
A little bit of Who Do You Love?
But pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
It's me and my guitar
Having fun, boogie-woogie, gotta, uh-huh, me and my guitar
Me and my guitar, me and my guitar I have tried to forget about you
And all the plans that we had planned
Yes, and I'm bound to leave this town
I don't care where I may land
If what they're telling me is true
You have found somebody new to love you
There ain't but one thing I can do, baby
To save my heart from being broken in two by you
Baby I'm moving through
There's nothing like a hundred miles between me and trouble in my mind
There's nothing like a hundred miles, show me the yellow line
There's nothing like a hundred miles when I'm only passing through
There's nothing like a hundred miles to make me forget about you
Forget about you, baby
Now don't we like our found farewells
And don't we like to keep our good-byes nice and clean
You may wish I'd go to hell
While you tell me what a pleasure it's been
So long, baby, I'm moving on
There's nothing like a hundred miles between me and trouble in my mind
There's nothing like a hundred miles, show me the yellow line
There's nothing like a hundred miles when I'm only passing through
There's nothing like a hundred miles to make me forget about you
Forget about you
I have tried to forget about you
And baby, I have failed
But just as long as I stay in Houston, I will We've seen some hard times, hard time
Holding it together ain't always easy
An angry man, hungry woman, driving each other crazy
It's so low down, show down, there's nothing else safe to say
Baby's on the town, baby's looking round, talking about walking away
Don't let go, got to give it one more chance
We've got to hold on, loving me may not make much sense
But I'm gone on you, baby, baby, I'm gone, and I want you back again
I may be wrong for you, baby, maybe I'm wrong but I love you just the same yeah
Now, we've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
Hard times, hard times, holding it together ain't always easy
Angry man, hungry woman, driving each other crazy
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
Through all those hard times, hard times
Holding it together ain't always easy
Hard times, hard times, holding it together ain't always easy
Face some hard times, hard times
Got to hold on, got to hold on
Face some hard times, holding it together ain't always easy
Hard times Excuse me? Excuse me, Miss?
Is that the way you look?
Is that the way you look?
Is that the way you look?
Is that really the way that you look now?
Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?
Is that really your eyes, is that really your hair?
Is that really the way you walk on by?
Are those the clothes you wear?
Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?
Woah, baby, oh baby, baby, baby
I got the question for you
Woah, baby, oh baby, baby, baby
Tell me now is it true?
Is that the way you look?
No, no I mean is that the way you really look?
Is that the way you look?
Is that the way you look?
Baby, maybe I'm dreaming, but I'll be bound
Whoever wakes me up, I'm gonna knock him down
Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?
Well I rubbed my eyes and I pinched my leg
And I asked my friend and I shook my head
But baby, is that the way you look? Life's good, friends are hard to find
And now one of mine is dead
And things I should have said to her
I shall say to you instead
Oh Mona, oh Mona
So much of you to love
There been too much of you to take care of
Mona, oh Mona
You got too big to keep and too damn old to eat
When you where just a football at your mama's side
I reckon everyone figured you for a barbecue when you died
And here I'm thinking about you
Lying underground pushing up a pine tree in my field
Oh, Mona, Mona, you can close your eyes
I've got a twelve-gauge surprise
Waiting for you
Since the day she passed away
Everything's just the same
Everywhere I go
Somebody mentions her name
Sometimes it's easiest
To tell a friend a lie
They don't understand
The way I feel
Oh, Mona, oh Mona
So much of you to love
There been too much of you to take care of
So long
Now she is gone
And I am left alone
As you can see
But ever since
I caused her death
Well I do miss her company Daybreak finds you up and alive
Just as though you could touch a star
But sunset seems to leave you weary
Alone and wondering who you are
Don't deny that lonely feeling, babe
That keeps stealing on you from deep down inside
Hey, can't you see that it's no good
Concealing a feeling it hurts you to hide?
When you can come home to me
Yes, I'm happy to hear
What you've got to say to me, baby, all the way
Girl, you can count on me
Watch those shadows fade away
And brighten your night with my day
Daybreak, sunset, hot and cold
Running smiles and tears
A bright outside to match your foolish pride
But not a word for the lonely years
Please come back home to me
Now you won't have to say
That you'll stay with me, baby, no, it's not that way
Just come back home to me
Watch those shadows fade away
And brighten your night with my day
Daybreak, sunset
You don't have to cry no more
Now, everything's gonna be just fine
Watch out, baby, here it comes
Right around the corner, here it comes
Just brighten your night with my day
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah Mon beau sapin, Roi des forêts
Que j'aime ta verdure!
Quand, par l'hiver, bois et guérêts
Sont dépouillés de leurs attraits
Mon beau sapin, Roi des forêts
Tu gardes ta parure
Toi, que Noël planta chez nous
Au saint anniversaire
Joli sapin, comme ils sont doux
Et tes bonbons et tes joujoux
Toi, que Noël planta chez nous
Tout brillant de lumière
Mon beau sapin, tes verts sommets
Et leur fidèle ombrage
De la foi qui ne ment jamais
De la constance et de la paix
Mon beau sapin, tes verts sommets
M'offrent la douce image As easy as rolling off a log
I found it easy, baby
To fall in love with you
It was as easy as rolling cigarettes
If that ain't easy
Maybe there's simpler things to do
For instance, let's cuddle
I love to cuddle
Get in a huddle
It's easy with you
As easy as rolling off a log
I really tumbled, baby
But what else could I do?
It's so easy to fall in love with you
I know that it's as easy as rolling off a log
It must be easy, baby
To say the sweet things you do
As easy as rolling off a log
I must be crazy, baby
But you make me think it’s true
Cause if I do say
I’ve heard a few say
The things that you say
So help me it’s true
This love stuff has got me in a fog
The guys all say they love you
No wonder that they do
It's so easy to fall in love with you Don't come to me with your sorrows anymore
I don't need to know how bad you're feeling today
I declare I've had my share and I've heard it all before
It's time for me to be stealing away
Let those rain clouds roll out on the sea
Let the sun shine down on me, hey, hey
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yes, it has
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around
When my sky was full of gray and my day was full of blue
There was nothing I could do to see myself through
Now my head is full of springtime and my heart is full of you
Goodbye lonely blue, it shall all come true
Miss November, I detect a frown
Close your eyes and turn it upside down, whoa, oh
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yes, don't you know
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yeah
Now I know you know what I've got to say
Is an old cliche anyway, so they say
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, oh whoa
Love has brought me around
Love has brought me around, yes it has Suzanne takes you down
To her place near the river
You can see the boats go by
And you can spend the night forever
And you know she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
Yes, and when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, all men will be sailors then
Until the seas free them
But He, Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken and almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
'Cause He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you besides the water
She is wearing rags, feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
She shows you where to look
Between the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
'Cause He's touched your perfect body with His mind Mount up, move on
May you find the way back home
Down and down we go
Down into bright October
Brothers in arms no more
Now that the war is over
Have you waded in and been to hell
Will you lie upon the sofa
See to the decoration of your shell
Now that the war is over
Mount up, move on
Damn the darkness, speed the dawn
They lost, we won
Try to find your way back home
Native son
Down and down we go
Now that the war is over
Brothers in arms no more
Now that the war is over
Have you waded in and been to hell
Will you lie upon the sofa
See to the decoration of your shell
Now that the war is over
Mount up, move on
Damn the darkness, speed the dawn
They lost, we won
May you find your way back home
Native son A tree grows in my back yard
It only grows at night
Its branches they're all twisted
Its leaves are afraid of light
They say them blues is just a bad dream
They say it lives upside your head
But when it's lonely in the morning
You're bound to wish that you was lyin' dead
There's winds out on the ocean
They're blowin' just as they choose
But them winds ain't got no emotion, baby
They don't know the blues
They say them blues is just a bad dream
They say it lives upside your head
But when it's lone, lonely in the morning
You're bound to wish that you was lyin' dead
My mind's ramblin' and ramblin'
Just like some a-rolling stone, no
Since that nightmare come to stay with me, baby
My thoughts just don't belong
They say them blues is just a bad dream, babe
They say it lives upside your head, hey hey
But when they visit you around midnight
You're bound to wish that you were lyin' dead Got the one room suite in the downtown motel
Got a lovely view
Classic shot of the parking lot
An off ramp of route 72
Half flat six pack of lukewarm beer
So lay down by my side
Like to whisper sweet nothings in my filthy ear
Until I'm satisfied
Baby-bootie
Juicy-fruity
Truck-stop cutie
Roadside-beauty
I'm in love with you
Hope it don't last too long
You got the mackerel eyes
Brought the side of fries
You got me hypnotized
I'm in love again
Now baby when I told you that I love you
I was only telling a lie
I'll be long gone come the crack of dawn
And I believe the word is good-bye, bye baby, bye, bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
I was only telling a lie
There ain't no need to act like I shot your dog, no
I was only telling a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
A-ha a-ha a-ha a-ha
Said no need, no need
Said no need, no need There ain't no melody
And I can't find a harmony
And if there were a way to say it
You know I would have played it
Well, I'm a man of few words
Trying to find a rhyme
And finally it occurred to me
That I'm wasting my time
There ain't no rhyme or reason
Isn't no time or season
Ain't no way around it
I know I would have found it
There ain't no song in the whole wide world
Could hardly sing about you
There ain't no song in the whole wide world
To tell you the way that I feel
Painters use their eyes
To show us what they see
But when that canvas dries
We all see it differently
There ain't black or white
Tthere ain't no day or night
There ain't no way around it
You know I would have found it
There ain't no song in the whole wide world
Could hardly sing about you
There ain't no song in the whole wide world
To tell you the way that I feel
No there ain't no melody
And I can't find no harmony
And if there were a way to say it
You know I would have played it
There just ain't no song in the whole wide world
Could hardly sing about you
There ain't no song in the whole wide world
To tell you the way I feel now
Singin' no, no, no, no, I might as well pack it on up
Not even this song's gonna tell you the way I feel now
(No song, no song, no song)
Not even this song's gonna tell you the way I feel baby Fetch down the fiddle, rosin up the bow
Don't play me nothing on the radio
Don't make me remember the Alamo
I'm feeling like a little bit of Cotton Eyed Joe
No raging Cajun crawfish stew
Fat batter coming in a Lumalamalu
Boy howdy and howdy damn do
Something like fine setting eyes on you
Let me come down
I won't never go back up again
Oh, hold me down
Let me come home
I won't never go away no more
Oh let me come down
In a younger day back in Tennessee
The muddy Mississippi used to call to me
Float on a river and set yourself free
Run from the farm and the family tree
Run from the runaway boy
So I've been all the places that I ever want to be
I've seen all the people that I ever want to see
I'm sick and tired of being lonely and free
I'm ready today for what's waiting on me
I'm gotta give up believing I was born to run
Stop acting like a man that gets shot from a gun
I'm putting down roots, I want to soak up sun
And stay right here until my days  are done
Let me back down
I will never go up again
Hold me down, tie me on down
Let me go home
I will never go away no more
Oh let me come home
Oh let me go down Yellow and rose, yellow and rose, yellow and rose

Oh boy, Botany Bay, watching the water go by
Here's your home so far away, here is a tear for your eye
Here is a vast and unknown land, here are the strangers on the sand

Oh, seeds of the universe ever endeavour to grow
Tiny pieces of everything, into the water they go
Everything changes for the strangers on the shore
They are blue and green no more, they are yellow and rose

Down under got the south side, this groovy crazy planet
Watching from the outside, it's as smooth as a gravy sandwich
People play music night for day, one caught the sun in a seeker


Remember when we thought we were in California? We thought it was the eye of the hurricane
Old gypsy woman she tried to warn you, ""You'll be back this way again
Hungry for the rain, it's written in your hand, plain


Yellow and rose, yellow and rose, yellow and rose When Liberty Valance came to town
Womenfolk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around
The men would step aside
Because the point of a gun
Was the only law
That Liberty understood
When it came to shooting
Straight and fast
Well he was mighty good
From out of the east
A stranger came
A law book in his hand
A man, the kind of a man
The west would need
To ease a troubled land
Because the point of a gun
Was the only law
That Liberty understood
When it came to shooting
Straight and fast
He was mighty good
Many a man would face his gun
And many a man would fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all
Now the love of a woman
Can make a man stay on
When he should go, stay on
Just trying to build
A peaceful life
Where love is free to grow
Because the point of a gun
Was the only law
That Liberty understood
When it came to shooting
Straight and fast
He was mighty good
Alone and afraid
She prayed that he'd return
That fateful night, that night
Nothing she said
Could keep her man
Going out to fight
But the point of a gun
Was the only law
That Liberty understood
When the final showdown
Came to pass
A law book was no good
Out in the sun two shots ring out
A shot made Liberty fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all We were walking in paradise, never did notice. Blind in the Buddha land, looking for solace
We had been told of a place, far beyond this vale of tears
We could never have guessed, we were already blessed
There we were, where we are in the garden

Didn't we climb on up Er Mei, temple to temple?
Yes and all and all along the way, the day was simple
Didn't we reach the top, didn't we gain our goal? Did we finally stop, surprised by the cold?

We were walking in paradise, never did tumble. Blind in the Buddha land, looking for trouble
We had been told of a place far beyond this vale of tears
We could never have guessed, we were already blessed
There we were, where we are, in the garden, in the garden Like being in love
Ooh, ooh
Like being in love
What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like being in love
And there's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Well it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I could swear I was falling
It feels like I’m falling
It's almost like being in love
Like being in love
When we walked out that day
Not a word did we say
It was almost like being in love
Put your hand there in mine
Made this world kind of fine
I could swear I was falling in love
Oh, the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing just for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I could swear I was falling
It feels just like falling
It's almost like being in love

C#m7 - a - a(w/ ho) - a - g9 Now you country fools in your one horse town you can laugh at me
It's plain as rain that you've never been down to the Southern sea
To see me now is like watching a fish on dry land
I only wish you could see me down in the islands
Mister, that's my home
What a fool I was to leave the only happiness I've known
You see me coming, you wink your eye and call me Captain Jim
And when I don't do nothing but to walk on by
You say babe, get a load of him
All I need is the sea and the sky and I know where I stand
Instead of you hicks straight out of the sticks deciding I ain't a man
You'll never understand
Up here I'm just a whisky bum but down there I'm a king
Sounds just like the angels up in heaven when they sing
Welcome home, welcome home
(Let me hear it) Such a sight to see
Instead of some Salvation Army sister
Singing ""Nearer My God To Thee""
Now I know that Yankee whisky has taken away my mind
And I know that rum is the only drink suitable to mankind
And I know that this tree I'm under is shaped entirely wrong
I need to see a gentle palm tree and I won't wait too long
I can feel that it's coming on strong
The first cold wind of winter is flapping in my clothes
Showing me the way with the direction that it blows
Welcome home, welcome home
Let it blow, welcome home
Welcome home, welcome home
It's such a sight to see
Instead of some Salvation Army sister
Singing ""Nearer My God To Thee""
Let me hear it oh yeah
Welcome home, welcome home
Welcome home mmh yeah
Welcome home, welcome home Little David, play on your harp, hallelu, hallelu
Little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah
Oh little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah, hallelujah
Little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah yeah
Hey now, I don't know for sure, but it's gets said, and I got told
Someone said that the streets of heaven are paved with solid gold
It must make a mighty good road
Little David, play upon your harp, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Won't you play your harp, hallelujah Day is ending, songbirds are wending
Back to the shelter of, each little nest they love
Nightshades falling, lovebirds are calling
What makes this world go ‘round?
Nothing but love
When whippoorwills cry, and evening is nigh
I hurry to my blue heaven
I turn to the right, a little white light
That leads me to my blue heaven
You’ll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room
A little love nest nestled where the roses bloom
Just Molly and me, and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven
My blue heaven
You’ll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room
Just a little love nest nestled where the roses bloom
Just Molly and me, and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven
My blue heaven Once upon a time a good friend of mine
Told me to tell y'all what I say today
Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better every day
You bet you better keep on you P's and Q's
If you don't the woman, you can easily lose
Oh, I had a love
A true love and I lost it
No one seems to understand
About the pain that it cost me
Woman's got to have it I believe that I should know
She's got to know that that she's needed around
When you kiss her you got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
(Think it over)
Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love
It was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain
That the true love cost me
Woman's got to have it, I believe
She's got to know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you got to make her feel it everyday, boy whoa
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground yeah
So if you've got a love, maybe you've got eyes to keep her
You've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it, all right, how she wants it
And every doggone time she thinks she needs it
Your woman needs it the same as mine
Woman got to have it from time to time
Woman got to have it
Woman got to have it
Woman got to have it oh whoa
Woman got to have it, oh yes she does, yes she does
Woman got to have it whoa whoa
Woman got to have it, that's what I say
Woman got to have it All last week and half of today
Johnnie has been a good little girl
Trying to keep her devils at bay
Watching her health return
But she always comes back for more
Hanging her head and banging my door
Johnnie comes back again
I said, Johnnie remember
Oh Johnnie, be good
""Please give me some medicine, man""
Oh, Johnnie comes back again
Where'd she get that tear in her eye?
Whoever said she could leave me
Where'd she learn to say good-bye?
She's been watching too much TV
She only shows up for meals
My medicine chest and my automobiles
Johnnie comes back again
I said, Johnnie remember
Oh Johnnie, be good, be good now
""Please give me some medicine, man, now""
Oh, Johnnie comes back again
Me, I'm just an evil demon
I'm playing on her weakness
Counting on her sickness
To bring her home again
To use me up and to rob me blind
I guess it shouldn't surprise me
Fighting and flashing like a fish on a line
My God, she must despise me
But she always comes back again
Now it won't be long til she's gone again
Johnnie comes back again
I said, Johnnie remember, remember
Oh Johnnie, be good, be good yeah
""Please give me some medicine, man""
Oh, my Johnnie comes back again and again and again
Oh Johnnie remember, remember
Johnnie, be good, be good
Johnnie remember, remember
Johnnie be good, no no no no
Come back and abuse me
Take my heart and use me
Be careful baby never lose me
Cause it's out in the streets no no no
Johnnie be good, Johnnie be good Are you there? Can you hear me? Somewhere near me?
In the morning, long ago, had to hold you so close, had to never let go
Time on the river sliding on by. Hard to believe, wink of an eye

Where'd you go, Baby Buffalo? What's become of old Cotton Eyed Joe?
Hold up, lying low, long gone come-a summertime snow

Talk to your doctor, making her rounds. Ninety-six tears, one thousand clowns
There they are, shining bright. True creation, pure delight
They go on, so do you. On and on, maybe me too

Long ago Baby Buffalo, what's become of old Cotton Eyed Joe?
Hold up, lying low, long gone come-a summertime snow

Hold on to now till you have to let go. Easy through your fingers, ever so
I'm just guessing, I don't know. Maybe it's a blessing, I sure hope so A catfish he tends to groove on the water
It's just where he's bound to be
And a monkey kind of flashes on fruits and bananas
So he lives in the top of a tree
But my eyes are made for darkness
And so the nighttime is right for me
Said I'm a night owl, honey
Sleep all day long
Now most folks they like the good daytime
They like to see the shining sun
They're up in the morning off and running
Till they're too tired for having fun
But when the sun goes down and them bright lights shine
My daytime has just begun
Whoa, I'm a night owl, honey
Whoa, Sleep all day long
Said turn off that bright light, baby
You're just about to drive me blind
Draw them curtains for me, mama
You watch and you'll see how my love light shines
Now, there's two sides to this great big world
And one of them is always night
Hey, if you can take care of business in the sunshine baby
I guess you're gonna be all right
But don't come looking for string bean to lend you a hand
Because my eyes they can't stand the light
No I'm a night owl, honey
Sleep all, sleep all day long
I said sleep all day long
Oh I'm a night owl, honey
Said I'm a night owl, honey, yeah yeah
Said I'm a night owl, honey
It's jumpin' on the night train comin' on by oh
I said yeah yeah yeah whoa yea
Night owl, baby
You gotta try just to taste it and wait and see
It's gonna be fine with me
Said I'm a night owl, baby
Gotta get it that I'm night owl, honey yeah yeah
Oh I'm a night owl, honey
I'm a night owl hoo
I'm a night owl, baby
I said hoo yeah oh oh Well I can't help it if I don't feel so good
Said I can't help it if I don't feel so good
If I had my way I'd be sitting on top of the world
But I can't help it if I don't feel so good
When the anger comes in and there's no place for a man to hide
When the anger comes in and there's no place for a man to hide
Would he do anything in the world and make him feel better inside?
When the anger comes in and there's no place for a man to hide
I'm gonna to sit back here, gonna watch this cloud roll by
I'm gonna to sit back here, I'm gonna this cloud roll by
The next time that you see me I should be shining like the fourth of July
I'm gonna sit back here, I'm gonna watch this cloud roll by
I ain't not looking for details
Won't you just gimme a clue?
Whoa Lord, What am I gonna to do?
Well I can't help it if i don't feel so good
No I can't help it if I don't feel so good
If I had my way, I'd be sitting on top of the world
I can't help it if I don't feel so good
I don't feel so good
I can't help it if I don't feel so good ha ha baby
Well I can't help it, I don't feel so good, no no no
Mama I can't help it, I don't feel so good whoa whoa yeah
No no can't help it
I can't help it if I don't feel so good Mama knows and papa knows that rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now
Baby been cutting his teeth on Bo Diddley's, I'm a man, man
Listen to the Wolfman howl
See the white man sailing his ship on the sea
Watch the white man shackle the black man to a tree
To the invader go the fruits of war
He misses home and his boots are sore
He has not got no roots no more
He comes for your gold
Watch out for your soul
Tennis shoes, and rhythm'n'blues
Are second generation
All across the nation now
Mama knows and papa too, that rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now
To the invader go the fruits of war
He misses home and his boots are sore
He has not got no roots no more
He comes for your gold
Watch out for your soul
'Cause mama knows and papa knows that rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now
I said rock'n'roll is music now
Yeah now, hey, hark
Rock'n'roll is music, rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now
Rock'n'roll is music, rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now
Rock'n'roll is music, rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now
Rock'n'roll is music, rock'n'roll is music
Rock'n'roll is music now When I've got something to say
Don't I always let you know?
So that you and I can go my way together
And if I get carried away
Well, I could be sailing on a song
And maybe we could carry on forever
But lately this old dog has been chasing his tail
Round and round and round
And the circles in my mind
They have been winding slowly down
Everybody's breezing up
But I'm seizing up
I'm freezing up
And I'm fading, I'm fading away
I've got a hold on a night in June
I've got room for you and me
I've got moonlight up in the trees
I've got sixty-eight degrees
I've got nothing on my mind
But I've got loving in my heart
And I've got something out in the garden
I want to show you
Well, it really doesn't matter after all
If we quit this roundabout
And no one will really notice
If we can just sit this next one out
You can strike up the band without me
You may have your doubts about me
But I'm just fading away
You can hardly even see me
'Cause I'm fading away
Well, it's hard to find a label
For this feeling in my bones
That this is all a make-believe
But my cards are on the table
And there ain't nothing up my sleeve
And here I thought I was a thinking man
But I'm a shrinking man
A sinking man
I'm fading, I'm fading away
Well it's really not so bad to be fading away
Come on 'long with me and we go fading away
You can hardly even hear me
'Cause I'm fading away Took my baby to the hop last night
What to my surprise
When we got there, she hit me with the news
Right between the eyes
She said she couldn't do the cha cha cha
My baby couldn't do the cha cha cha
She couldn't cha cha cha
No she couldn't cha cha cha
My baby couldn't do the cha cha cha
I told her not to worry no
They'd play some other dance
But we sat there for an hour and a half
And we never got a chance
For every song they played was the cha cha cha
They played nothing but the cha cha cha
All night long, gimme the midnight hour (all night)
Every number was a cha cha cha
I told her not to worry
There's still one thing we can do
Let me take you by your hand tonight
I wanna teach this dance to you
Come on baby ha (baby)
Taught my baby how to cha cha cha that time
Right there right on
Taught my baby how to cha cha cha
Kept on dancing for an hour or two
What do you think I'd see
We hadn't practiced for a time or two around
She was doing it better than me
You know my baby loves the cha cha cha
Oh oh yeah now every night every day
Taught my baby how to cha cha cha
Everybody loves the cha cha cha
Little children love the cha cha cha oh whoa
Come on cha cha cha
Baby loves the cha cha cha
Everybody loves the cha cha cha
Come on yourself come on come on now
Everybody loves the cha cha cha (come on)
Every now every one
They love the cha cha cha
Every night every night
Everybody loves the cha cha cha (ay)
Everyone ooh
Sam Cooke himself in the midnight hour
Everybody loves the cha cha cha oh whoa Gee it's great after staying out late, walking my baby back home
Arm in arm, over meadow and farm, walking my baby back home
We go on harmonizing a song or she's reciting a poem
Owls fly by and they give me the eye, walking my baby back home
We stop for awhile, she gives me a smile and cuddles her cheek to my chest
We start to pet and that's when I get her powder all over my vest
After I kind of straighten my tie, she has to borrow my comb
It's one kiss then we continue again walking my baby back home

After I kind of straighten my tie, she has to borrow my comb
It's one kiss then we continue again walking my baby back home I'm not much for making little wishes
But I'd like a little wish to come true for you
I'm not talking about loaves and fishes
But I wish that there was something I could do for you
Here's a little bit of cheap advice
To be taken in an hour of need
Don't assume that the life you left
Is the life you have to lead
When you come home what you gonna do
Oh brother, oh brother
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true
The same mess of misery that you done been through
Standing in line and it's waiting for you
One kiss leads to another
Brother when you come back home
I'd like to know who's knocking on door
I'd like to know what they come here for
You'd like to say no
But the words won't come
Come in and sit down, seem to roll off your tongue
You forget to remember, to never die young
One kiss leads to another
Brother when you come back home
Standing in line, all of your friends
Standing in line, party never ends
Standing in line, the river flows, the river bends
Standing in line, all of your friends
When you come home what you gonna do
Oh brother, oh brother
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true
The same mess of misery that you done been through
Standing in line and it's waiting for you
One kiss leads to another
Brother when you come back home
And that moon will be
Monn will be shining in the trees
All night long
Something bound to happen for sure
Soon you'll be
Stopping by talking to a friend again
Swear you ain't never tasted nothing so pure
Oh when you come home what you gonna do my my
Oh brother, oh brother
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true
The same mess of misery that you done been through
Standing in line and it's waiting for you
One kiss leads to another
Brother when you come back home
When you come home, your friends are dropping by
When you come home, the moon is gonna shine
When you come home, I tell you no lie
When you come home, they're gonna offer you a line
Standing in line, all of your friends
Standing in line, party never ends now
Standing in line, the river flows, the river bends
Standing in line, all your so called friends
Standing in line, when you come home
Standing in line, oh brother, oh brother now
Standing in line, when you come home
Standing in line, what you're gonna do now
Standing in line la la la la Daddy's baby, what's got you thinking?
What's got you sinking so low?
Is there something I should know?
Something new to you?
Daddy's baby fussing and fretting
Keeping on getting it wrong
She can only last so long
She's going for a song
So sing her a lullaby-bye, bye
Baby don't like to cry
So sing her a lullaby-bye, bye
Swaddle and swing her
Sing her a lullabye
She makes her feelings known to me
Her every side is shown to me
And in our time alone
My love has surely grown of its own
Silent as a stepping stone
Silently as the dawn was breaking
Soft and clear and my tears were dry
And my fears had flown
So I called my love my home
La la la la When I take you out tonight with me
Honey, here's the way it's gonna be
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses
In the slickest gig you'll ever see
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin’ strutters
Nosy folks they’ll peek through the shutters
And their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yellow, the upholstery’s brown
The dashboard's genuine leather
With Isinglass curtains you can roll right down
In case there's a change in the weather
Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin’
That I'd care to swap
For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top
Now would you say that fringe was made of silk?
I wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
Now I can see the stars gettin' blurry
When we ride back home in the surrey
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey
With the fringe on top
I can feel the day gettin' older
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder
Noddin', droopin', close to my shoulder
Till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill
The moon is taking a header
And just when I'm thinkin' all the earth is still
A lark wakes up in the meader
Hush, you bird my baby's a-sleepin'
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa, you team, just keep on a-creepin'
At a slow clip, clop
Don't you hurry little surrey with the fringe on the top Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows some holly and some mistletoe
Well, they help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies in his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to one hundred-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, yeah, Merry Christmas to you Something's wrong, that restless feeling's been
Preyin' on your mind
Road maps in a well-cracked ceiling
The signs aren't hard to find
Now I'm not sayin' that you've been mistreated
No one's hurt you, nothing's wrong
A moment's rest was all you needed
So pack your things and kindly move along
Like dust in the wind
You're gone forever
You're wind-blown leaves
You're a change in the weather
Just a town like any other
A second brand new start
A third or fourth hand, wife or lover, no
You won't break her heart
Take some bacon, go on and leave your watch chain
She won't count on nothing more
Wrap your hands around that small change
And tiptoe barefoot out the door
Yes, something's wrong, that restless feeling's been
Preyin' on my mind
When things get bad
I'm bound to pack my bags and just
Leave them all behind My heart had been broken
And I couldn't take no more
I shuttered up my windows
And I bolted tight my door
Then I took one look at you
And nearly lost my mind
Now I'm going round going round
Going round going around one more time
Yes I'm going round going round
Going round going around one more time
Betty was a little heartbreaker
It didn't quite work out
She did a number on my confidence
I was riddled with self doubt
I said that's it, I'm through
I quit, then Juanita, she looked so fine
Now I'm going round going round
Going round going around one more time
Yes I'm going round going round
Going round going around one more time
Round and round in a circle
Ah it's always the same
One moment you swear you've had enough
The next you've got to know her name
All on my own, it wasn't that bad
I was getting by as I could get
I stopped into a drug store
For one pack of cigarettes
She didn't have a quarter
Had to call her cousin Kate
And could I lend her maybe one thin dime?
Now I'm going round going round
Going round going around one more time
Said I'm going round watch me now
One more time
I'll be going round going round
And going round and going around one more time
I'll be going round going round
And going round and going around one more time
I'll be going round whoa
One more time
Yes I'll be going round going round
And going round and going around one more time
I'll be going round going round
And going round and going around one more time
I'll be going around one more time Believe it or not
I've been waiting for you to come through
Love of my life
Believe it or not
I've been waiting for you to come through
Love of my life
And though the hour grew later and later
I would hold on for one more heartbeat
While my friends around me were calling
""Today, today, today, today""
As strange as it seems
I remember your face from before
Believe it or not
Before you and I were washed up
On this alien shore
As strange as that seems
Though the hour grew later and later
Still I'd hold on for one more heartbeat
While my friends around me were calling
""Today, today, today, today""
Today the world seems brighter
Light and bright and right somehow
I could not have held on tighter
Waiting for the past to come to pass, no no
Once in a dream
I've seen myself through your eyes
This you should know
Wading the stream
That flows in between you and I
Once in a dream
And though the hour grows later and later
I would hold on for one more heartbeat
While my friends around me were calling
""Today, today, today, today, today"" My lady don't allow the life I lead
She don't abide by some of the company that I keep
She takes occasion to criticize and carry on
I love her so, I just can't stand it no more
I'm a fool for you babe, don't you know
Mess around momma, I'm a fool for you mamma, ooh
I should say, my baby knows that I'm crazy about her loving
That's all right, she takes unfair advantage now and then
She jumps at the chance to tease me with her body
Lord, I love that thing so, just can't stand it no more
I'm a fool for you babe
Look around, momma, I'm a fool for you
Let's have a sweet thing today I don't have much to say
Thought I'd call you up anyway
Just to try to show you the way
That I feel today
Oh, I miss you, baby
I sure am on the road
I don't need to say much more
Just the same old well-known stranger
That I was before
It seems like yesterday now
Daddy's all gone
Only halfway home
He's holding on to the telephone
Saying, please, don't let the show go on
There's a bus every other hour
There's even the midnight train
But that don't leave me the power
To see your face again
It's not that simple
You see, there's a room full of smiling faces
There's a man standing by the door
Says it's time to change our places
And get down on the floor
And kill them, baby ha
Daddy's all gone
He's just halfway home
He's holding on to the microphone
Singing: Please, don't make the show go on Come on, baby, while the moon is high
Kick up your heels and dance
Don't be nervous and don't be shy
And give yourself a chance, you can dance
Kick off your shoes and lose your blues
Pick them up, Lord, put them back down
And around, and around, and around, and around
Come on, baby, it must be fun
To be dancing in the clear moonlight
Otherwise, would everyone be out
On such a cold and windy night? We can dance
Throw yourself away
Holy month of May, you can dance
Listen to the music of the steel guitar, don't it sound good, hey now
Nobody here tonight came to look at you, no, no no
Well I bet you five dollars that somebody starts a fire back in the woods, hey now
Everybody here tonight came to boogie and have a good time, too
Come on, baby, while the moon is high
Kick up your heels and dance
Don't be nervous and don't be shy
And give yourself a chance, you can dance
Kick off your shoes and lose your blues
Pick them up, Lord, put them back down
And around, and around, and around, and around
And if I could lose my mind
If I could throw myself away And the light between us
Which we couldn't quite extinguish
Which we see at dawn
Burns on (burns on)
First day of May
Things are beginning
Our side is winning
Hip hip hooray
Made in the shade
Deep in the shadow
Down by the meadow
Lie in my arms
And the moon will rise
Before our very eyes
We will rise too
I'll be with you
It's a rite of spring
A horizontal thing
The sweetest sort of dance
Hidden in among the plants
Ha ha ha ha
People are laughing
Children are singing
Come join the dance
And the walls around us
Which we kept at such a cost
When we turned around
Came tumbling down
Ha ha ha ha
She can't stop laughing
He can't stop singing
First day of May James Taylor---How I Know You
Music by Elton John
I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
You witnessed our abduction which possibly explains
How I know you
How I know you
Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed
A privileged existence, for my father was employed
As advisor to the king, no less, which surely rings a bell
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell
How I know you
How I know you
Enough of reminiscence, and such happy memories
The reason why I know you well is really none of these
It's just you reek of royalty, you ooze uncommon grace
I'd know you were a princess, in any time and place
Yes I know you
How I know you
Yes I know you
How I know you No I don't know how to love you
The way you want me to
Cause every time I try
Something always changes with you

First it's cold baby
And then there's too much heat
One minute I'm up in heaven
And the next I'm down in the street

Cause we got a love
That's bittersweet
I said we got a love
It's bittersweet

Sometimes when I'm with you
It's like you're just not there
When I look into your eyes
I see that thousand yard stare
Then you're back in love with me
Like you can't get enough
Rough into smooth
And the smooth back into the rough


I don't know anybody
Anybody like you
I never met anybody
Could make me feel the way you do
I wish that I could love you
The way you want me to
So scared you'll pull out the rug
Darling if I do



Flaming hot
Then not
Ooh, bitter memory
I said we got a love, ooh
We got a love Un mejor Dia Vendra by
Un mejor dia vendra
Un mejor dia vendra
Cuando dios a los pobres un lugar dara
Cuando madura la tarde
Yuelvo cansado a mi hogar
Y sonando en un futuro
Olvido dolor y pesar
Donde se ha ido mi vida?
Donde se ha ido mi juventud?
Perdidas en las palabras
Que el viento me trae
""Un dia mejor vendra""
Donde se ha ido mi vida?
Donde se ha ido mi juventud?
Perdidas en las palabras
Que el viento me trae
""Un dia mejor vendra""
Un mejor dia vendra
Un mejor dia vendra
Cuando dios a los pobres un lugar dara Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound and rode it into Raleigh
And all across Caroline
We stopped in Charlotte but we bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling out of Georgia state
Had some motor trouble
That turned into a struggle
Half way across Alabam
That hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham
So right away I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' across Mississippi clean
And I was on that Special Flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Someone's got to help me get out of Louisiana
Just to help me get to Houston town
There's an uncle there who cares a little 'bout me
And he won't let the poor boy down
He sure as you're born he bought me a silk suit
Put some luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the Promised Land
Working on a T-bone steak, a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us that in thirteen minutes
He would have us at the terminal gate
Swing down chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal dome
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four, ten-o-nine
Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling
And the poor boy is on the line
Long distance information I was raised up family, man, I'm glad I'm on my own
I was raised up family, man, I'm glad I'm on my own
I mean, God bless the child that can learn to live alone, yeah
Thinking about my cousin, what it was that did him in
Could it have been that whiskey, rotgut, bootleg, bathtub gin?
It's like it took a lot of liquor just to let him live in his own skin
Back in Raleigh, North Carolina, you got to ride it on back in Raleigh, North Carolina
The ship set down on the shore of this uncharted desert island
Me and my people fanned out, I guess we settled down a little while
Ah, but the devil came with the dark days of winter, man, the children ran wild
I used to know why, no, I don't know why anymore
I used to know why, no, I don't know why no more
I get to wonder at the Kundalini thunder, down under my floor
You got to ride it on back, take me back
Back in Raleigh, North Carolina, yeah, do you want to go?

Way back in Raleigh, North Carolina J'ai trouvé cette chanson française
Mise dans un coin
Tout au fond de mon crâne
Pas encore exprimée
Et donc je manque des idées anglaises
Paraître, peut-être, quelque chose, je n'ai pas pensé
Si je dis que je t'aime
Ce n'est pas tout à fait
La vielle même chose
Car les mots que je dis
Ne viennent pas du même ésprit
Et me voici, baby
Etranger nouveau
J'essaye et j'essaye mais je sais
Que je n'ai pas assez de français
Mais qu'est ce qu'on peut dire?
Il me faut finir
Suffisant à dire
Je ne vais jamais écrire
Encore une chanson française
Whoa au revoir, mes amis
Je vous aime beaucoup I laughed at sweethearts
I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts
They seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland
It was my heart's domain
I see your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain!
I took one look at you
That’s all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still
Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That secret touch of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still
Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That secret touch of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still
Oh that moment when my heart stood still It was a hot and sultry day somewhere in early September
I don't hardly remember the day
Just the way the sun beat down upon the bay, baby
I did not even need to know your name
It was, oh, so plain to see that you had eyes for me
Halfway open, halfway closed, half-naked eyes for me, baby
It was a slow burning love, a fair-weather love affair
A slow burning, smoldering love for you and I
And like the sun on the edge of the Western sky, it died
Oh, the lights of the city were close at hand
I might just as well have been another man
You might just as well have been another girl
It might just as well have been another world
It was a slow burning love, a fair-weather love affair
A slow burning, smoldering love for you and I
And like the sun on the edge of the Western sky, it died
Oh, slow burning love
You were smoking up that day, some kind of hot
It was a slow burning love, a fair-weather love affair
A slow burning, smoldering love for you and I
And like the sun on the edge of the Western sky, it died Hand me down my golden crown and let me ride
Don't deny the highway in my soul
Jump and sing that silver thing that I feel inside yeah
Hallelujah, let that big wheel roll
It's time to give me just a little bit of old time glory
I'm talking about the coming of the sunshine story
Set this poor soul free, let it be whoa yeah
Break these bonds that hold my soul and I'm on my way
I can't help feeling there's no time to lose
I done made my mind up yesterday that I just can't stay
So hand me down my highway shoes
It's time to give me just a little bit of old time glory
Talking about the coming of the sunshine story
Set this poor soul free, let it be Working on a thing
Working on a thing
Funny little thing I know
Sure got to like it
Only thing I got to show you
Running around the room
In my Fruit o' the Loom
And a cuppa cuppa coffee
From King Tut's tomb
Save me, no more no Lumalamalu
Sure enough I must have been mokus
And so out of focus
To miss the first half of the show
Oh, it gets to the end
We get to run it again
Just like before
One more go round
Drank myself some wine
Back in '69
I was fooling around
With my friends in my spare time
Lord now life along the river
Knobby little knees
In the summer breeze
Hammock and a couple of trees
Swing low oh oh
If you please, say yeah
Oh, I must have been mokus
And so out of focus
I missed the whole half of the show
Come to the end
And they run it again
Same as before
One more go round
Same as before now
Make it cool
After all this time
Of fooling around it
And never having nothing to show
Yeah, I'm happy to say that
I finally found it
Right underneath my own nose
Oh, I must have been mokus
And so out of focus
I missed the first half of the show yeah
Please don't let it end
I want it again
Just like before
One more go round
Running on down the road
Na na na na I dreamed last night, I got on the boat to heaven
And by some chance, I had brought my dice along
And there I stood, and I hollered ""Somebody fade me!""
But the passengers all knew right from wrong
For the people all said sit down
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat
The people all said sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat
And the devil will drag you under
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat
I sailed away, on that little boat to heaven
And by some chance, found a bottle in my fist
And there I stood, nicely passin' out the whisky
But the passengers were bound to resist
For the people all said ""Beware
You’re on a heavenly trip.""
The people all said ""Beware
Beware, you'll scuttle the ship!""
And the devil will drag you under
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat
And as I laughed at those passengers to heaven
A great big wave came and knocked me overboard!
And as I sank, and I hollered ""Someone save me!""
That's the moment I woke up
Thank the Lord!
And I said to myself, sit down
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat
I said to myself sit down
Sit down, sit down you're rockin' this boat
And the devil will drag you under
With a soul so heavy you'd never float
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down, stop rockin' the boat Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it's still good news
Mama may have, Papa may have
God bless the child that's got his own
So the strong get more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don’t seem to make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
You’ve got money, you’ve got lots of friends
Hangin’ all around your door
When it’s all gone and the spendin' ends
No they don't come around no more
Rich relations bring crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself, just don't take too much
Well, Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
Rich relations bring crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself, just don't take too much
Well, Mama may have, Papa may have
Ah, but God bless the child that can stand up and say
I’ve got my own Whoa, Jocko, don't expect me to come out drinking, messing around
Spending my time with a bunch of crazy people
Yes, I been there before
I don't need to go back no more
I'm just a family man, like it or not
I am a family man, I'm a-holding onto what I've got
I'm a family man, right by damn
I finally find out that what I am is a family man
And don't expect me to hit the road
At a moment's notice without my suitcase
With some crazy bunch of strangers in some unknown car
Well, I'm just not willing to go that far
The life I used to lead was a little too frantic
I guess I just got eyes to grow old and grey
And if what I have in mind isn't super romantic
I guess I always saw myself this way
I'm just a family man, like it or not
That I am a family man, I'm a-holding onto what I've got
I'm a family man, oh yeah right by damn
I finally find out what I am is a family man
Sears and Roebuck, Howard Johnson
Colonel Sanders, Station wagon
Briggs and Stratton, second mortgage whoa
If I can ever lose my blues babe
Walk on over, turn on the TV
What I'd like to do is lie down on the sofa later on
I might walk my dog, baby whoa
Bo Diddley's a family man Back a long time ago, a million years BC
All the best things in this life, were absolutely free
But no one appreciated, a sky that was always blue
And no-one anticipated, a moon that was always new
So it was planned that they would vanish now and then
And we must pay before we get them back again
That's what storms were made for
You shouldn't be afraid for
Every time it rains it rains, pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains, pennies from heaven, Baby
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Make sure that your umbrella is upside down
Well you, trade it for a package of, sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, well you must have showers
So when you hear it thunder don't run under the tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and for me
Pennies from heaven
Buddaly bay, bee bop
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade it for a package of, sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and for me
Yah, pennies from heaven Down the end of the barroom
Out of sight of the light in the window
His mind in his whiskey and his body in a folding chair
Far beyond repair
I enter his vision
He watches me look for my seat
He makes his decision and he stands to his feet
Lord, it's a long way down
It happened to me, wonderful sight
Only for me only for you
It happened to be a light shining through
From one who was lost and found
Just like me and you
Old man says, ""Young man, my you're looking pretty green yeah
Like a stranger to this kind of place
Come sit at my table, come and look into my face
I've got a story to tell
There was a father and son
But that was a long time ago
And when the time came to run
I just couldn't say no so I left them behind""
It happened to me, wonderful sight
Only for me, only for you
It happened to be a light shining through
From one who was lost and found
Just like me and you
We have seen it before
In times of great sorrow
That human compassion will flow
From a well that has long run dry
It happened to me, wonderful sight
Only for me, only for you
It happened to be a light shining through
From one who was lost and found
Just like me and you, oh yes Someone
I'm searching for someone who'll be true
Who'll change my life of blue
Into a dream of golden rainbows
Where are you?
It seems I've been searching, searching more than just one lifetime
My heart is a magnet all for you
I'll know you when I see you
Within my heart is carved a sculpture of your love
Life is worth less than nothing without love
Love is the force from which all beings live
Don't you see?
It's the purpose of living to love and be loved again and again
Where are you?
My heart cries for you
My eyes long to see you
My soul is all for you
Oh, where are you, someone?
Don't you see?
It's the purpose of living to love and be loved again and again
Where are you?
My heart cries for you
My eyes long to see you
My soul is all for you
Oh, where are you, someone? Talkin' bout Jumping Jim
Talkin' bout Mud Slide Slim
Don't you know that a fish got to swim
Don't a goose got to fly high?
Little dog got to die
And I'm goin' home
Woh, don't you know
Woh, don't you know
Talkin' bout a life on the street
Goin' to thinkin' about an itch in my feet
Can't you hand me down them highway shoes?
The Lord knows I'm talking about the walkin' blues
Got the rockin' pneumonia blues
And I'm headed home, bye-bye
Woh, don't you know
Woh, don't you know babe babe
Listen here now, don't you come round
Talkin' bout over yonder (listen)
Bound to wake up the walkin' man in me
And I'm bound to wanderin', hey now
Talkin' all about spoonin' into bone
Lookin' just like Sherlock Holmes
Searchin' for a needle in a haystack
Seein' and eatin' lots of fatback babe
Jumpin' about a railroad track
I'm goin' home goodbye
Woh, don't you know
Woh, don't you know whoa
Woh, don't you know
You ought to know
You ought to know
You ought to know
You ought to know like a fish in the stream
Ought to know like a leaf on the tree
Ought to know like a boat in the sea Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Troll the ancient Yule tide carol
Fa la la la la, la la la la
See the blazing Yule before us
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la, la la la la
While I tell of Yule tide treasure
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Fast away the old year passes
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Hail the new, ye lads and lasses
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Sing we joyous, all together
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Heedless of the wind and weather
Fa la la la la, la la la la My romance doesn't need to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no shining star
No hideaway, no soft guitars
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake
I can make
My most fantastic dreams come true
Cause my romance
It doesn't need a thing but you, sweet baby yeah
Wide awake
I can make
My most fantastic dreams come true
Yes, my romance
It doesn't need a thing but you I will not lie
I will not lie
I will not lie
I will not lie for you
Every time I see you fooling around on him
I can't help but remember that he calls me his friend
It's only right for me to tell you
When it's the wrong thing to do
It's only right that you should know
If he comes to me
I will not lie for you
No, I won't lie for you
It's hard enough to see him stumbling blind
I refuse to see him lose you and me at the same time
It's only right for me to tell you
When it's the wrong thing to do
It's only right that you should know
If he comes to me
I will not lie for you
No, I won't lie for you
To come here as your friend
And have you come on like my lover
Like to bring things to an end
Between myself and my brother
If it was any other man I would not interfere
But if you come on to me again, I don't see how to stand clear
It's only right for me to tell you
When it's the wrong thing to do
It's only right that you should know
If he asks me
I will not lie for you
Mama, I won't lie for you
If it was any other man I would not interfere no
But if you come on to me again, I don't see how to stand clear
It's only right for me to tell you
When it's the wrong thing to do
It's only right that you should know
If he asks me
I will not lie
I will not lie
I will not lie
I will not lie for you
No, I won't lie for you
Little girl, I won't lie for you
No, I won't lie to him for you
I will not lie for you Poor puppy, you look so sad
I guess you think that no one ever felt so bad before
Everybody has the blues
Everybody has the blues
Everybody knows the way that you feel today
Everybody gets to sit and cry
Everybody gets to wonder why
Everybody gets to watch the sky turn grey
Maybe you lost your job
Maybe you lost your girl
Maybe you feel like you're losing your mind
That's not the end of the world
Everybody gets to feel some pain
Everyone got to get caught out in the rain
Everybody got some days that they can't explain
Everybody got the blues
Everybody has the blues
Everybody knows the way that you feel today Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
Beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is a bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we roll along
Walking in a winter wonderland
 
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?, we'll say, No man, no
But you can do the job, when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland  I got holy children to show me the light
Singing hallelujah, brother how about you?
Yeah, we got holy scriptures here that prove us to be right
In believing out loud what we wish to be true
Well I got stoned out neighbors to take me in tow
Singing close your eyes, singing open wide
Watch the world fall away below, let the winter wind blow
And where will we hide when it comes from inside?
Oh, hear me now, hear me now, hear me now
Hear me now, hear me now, hear me now
Hear me now, listen I got sweet, sweet music sometimes
Yes, a child inside me was alone in the night
Now has come to me, love has set my soul free
As a man and a woman stand alone in the night
Here is reason to be like the sun on the sea I Am Jeremiah Dixon
I Am A Geordie Boy
A Glass Of Wine With You, Sir
And The Ladies I'll Enjoy
All Durham And Northumberland
Is Measured Up By My Own Hand
It Was My Fate From Birth
To Make My Mark Upon The Earth
He Calls Me Charlie Mason
A Stargazer Am I
It Seems That I Was Born
To Chart The Evening Sky
They'd Cut Me Out For Baking Bread
But I Had Other Dreams Instead
This Baker's Boy From The West Country
Would Join The Royal Society

We Are Sailing To Philadelphia
A World Away From The Coaly Tyne
Sailing To Philadelphia
To Draw The Line
The Mason-Dixon Line
Now You're A Good Surveyor, Dixon
But I Swear You'll Make Me Mad
The West Will Kill Us Both
You Gullible Geordie Lad
You Talk Of Liberty
How Can America Be Free
A Geordie And A Baker's Boy
In The Forests Of The Iroquois
Now Hold Your Head Up, Mason
See America Lies There
The Morning Tide Has Raised
The Capes Of Delaware
Gome Up And Feel The Sun
A New Morning Is Begun
Another Day Will Make It Clear
Why Your Stars Should Guide Us Here...

We Are Sailing To Philadelphia
A World Away From The Coaly Tyne
Sailing To Philadelphia
To Draw The Line
The Mason-Dixon Line Chorus:
Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning
Say, wasn't that a mighty storm
Blew all the people away
Well, Galveston had a sea wall
Meant to keep the water down
High tide from the ocean
Sent water over Galveston
Chorus
Yeah, year was 1900
Fifty long years ago
Death came walking on the water that day
Death calls, you gotta go
Now the trumpets,they sounded warning
Said it's time to leave this place
But no one thought about leaving town
Til death stared them in the face
Chorus
Right then the sea started boiling
A thing that no ship could stand
I thought I heard a captain crying out
Somebody save a drowning man
They had two trains loaded
With people trying to leave town
Tracks gave way to the water now
And all of those people drowned
Chorus
I said the year was 1900
Fifty long years ago
Death came walking on the water
Death calls, you gotta go
I said Death, your hands are clammy
You got them on my knee
You came and threw a stone at my mother
And now you're coming after me
Chorus
Chorus It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It’s just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, no, no
It's just the nearness of you
When you’re in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you would only grant me
The right to hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night, the nearness of you
When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams, I see them all come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you would only grant me
The right, to hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night, the nearness of you
Just the nearness of you
Just the nearness of you, baby
Just the nearness of you Shall I tell it again how we started as friends
Who would run into one another now and again
At the Yippee Cai O or the Mesa Dupree
Or a dozen different everyday places to be
I was loping along living alone
We were ever so brave on the telephone
Would you care to come down for fireworks time
We could each just reach
We step out of line
And the smell of the smoke and the lay of the land
And the feeling of finding one's heart in one's hand
And the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing
""love must stand""
Love forever and ever must stand
Unbelievable you, impossible me
The fool who fell out of the family tree
The fellow that found the philosopher's stone
Deep underground like a dinosaur bone
Who fell into you at a quarter to two
With a tear in your eye for the Fourth of July
For the patriots and the minutemen
And the things you believe they believed in then
Such as freedom, and freedom's land
And the kingdom of God and the rights of man
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band
Singing ""love must stand""
Love forever and ever must stand
And forever must stand
Oh the smell of the smoke as we lay on the land
And the feeling of finding my heart in my hand
With the tiny, tin voice of the radio band
Singing ""love must stand""
Love forever and ever must stand
All on the Fourth of July
On the Fourth of July Mescalito has opened up my eyes, ahhhh
Mescalito has set my Mind at ease, ahhhh
Mescalito has opened up my eyes
Set my mind at ease, ahhhhh Now back when this earth was a silver blue jewel
And back when your grandfather's fathers were young
Men of these shores made and gave up their lives
Pulling up fish from the sea
While down in the African slavery trade
Stealing young men to cut sugar cane
Rum to New Bedford and codfish from Maine
They were building a wall that will always remain
Oh, the crown and the cross, the musket and the chain
The white man's religion, the family name
Two hundred years later and who is to blame?
The captain or the cargo or the juice of the sugar cane?
The doryman he knows when the riptides will run
He sets out his nets and he waits in the sun
He thinks of his family and drinks of his rum
And he waits for the codfish to come
It's the same goddam ocean that keeps them alive
It will swallow you up, it will let you survive
It will heal you and steal you and take you away
Like a note in a bottle with nothing to say
Now back when this earth was a silver blue jewel
Back when your grandfather's fathers were young
Men of these shores made and gave up their lives
Pulling up fish from the sea Mama makes the music and she makes the news
She dances all night in her golden shoes
She's high flying, going, going, gone
She'll be halfway to Heaven by the hour that the morning comes
And papa's kacked out with his head in his lap
Mama likes to think that he's taking a nap
Because he's working so hard, working all night long
He'll be halfway to hell in the hour that the morning comes
Like a bat out of hell in the moonlight
Like the pieces of the picture that you broke last night
I'm sure it's gonna be all right
I'll be halfway heavy by the hour that the morning comes
Oh, look at that fool with the lampshade on
Somebody told him he was having fun
But they were wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
If he's a fool enough he might open his eyes when the morning comes along
Now look at that secret agent man
Sneaking out of church with blood on his hands
He's for sale, going, going, gone
He'll be the first to know and the last to go when the shit hits the fan
Gimme little water, gimme little wine
You're looking at a man who's been out in the sunshine
Just a little too long, little bit too long
But I'll be halfway home in the hour that the morning comes Morning, sing me a song
Afternoon, bring it along
Nighttime, show me a friend
Say it again
Send a good dream my way
Wednesday, feeling just fine
I got to say time on my hands
Friday, look at them run
Show me some fun
Taking the sunshine in
God knows you've got to give yourself time to think these days
Lord knows you've got to take enough time to look both ways
The pieces fly by so quickly now
Laura, look at you walk
I swear you've got eyes in my head
I'd like to follow you down, show you around
Borrow the crown you wear
Bacon, lie on that plate
The black-eyed peas wait on the side
Gravy, chicken and rice
Isn't it nice?
Tell me the price of food
What happens when the answers they give you aren't good enough, baby no?
What happens when it rains for eight days on your week off?
You know you can't buy tomorrow, no
It's all a matter of opening up your eyes
And looking around
'Cause it's all there
Yeah baby said it's all there
I said taking the sunshine in
Yeah yeah yeah There’s an old man called the Mississippi
Now that’s the old man that I love to be
Oh, what does he care if the world's got troubles?
What does he care if the land’s not free?
Old man river
That old man river
Well he must know somethin'
But he don't say nothin'
He keeps on rollin'
He just keeps rollin' along
And he don’t plant taters
And he don't plant cotton
Yes and them that plants 'em is soon forgotten
He keeps on rollin’
He just keeps rollin' along
Oh, you and me, we’re just the same
Bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge, better lift that bale
You get a little drunk and you land in jail
I get weary
And sick of tryin'
Till I’m tired of livin'
And I’m scared of dyin'
But old man river, keeps on rollin’
That old man river, he just keeps on rollin’
I said that old man river, keeps on rollin’ along
Old man river I don't care if I got no money
I don't care if I got a dime
All I want to do is to dance with you honey
Please tell me that you have the time
'Cause I got to get back on my feet again
Got to get back on the street again
La la la la la

Well, I don't care if I got no fame
All I want to do is to hold your hand
Don't care if nobody knows my name
'Cause I just want to try the best I can, yes I do
Gotta get back on my feet again
Gotta get back on the street again yeah
La la la la la

And I don't know just what is going on, and momma do you?
Well, all I really know is I got to get back on my feet again, yeah baby

Stand it up for me now Money, who needs it
Let me live a life free and easy
Put a toothbrush in my hand
Let me be a traveling man
Road runner, baby
'Cause I'm a road runner, baby
Can't stay in one place too long
'Cause I'm a road runner, baby
You might look at me and I'll be gone
Well, you can love me if you want to
Yeah, but I do declare
When I'm getting restless, yeah
You know I got to move somewhere, yeah

'Cause I'm a road runner, baby
Anywhere's my home ground
I'm going to love the life I live
I'm going to live the life I love
Road runner, baby

Don't want no woman to tie me down
Got to be free baby, free to roam around
All my life I've been like this
And you can love me at your own risk
When the dust hit my shoes I got the urge to move


He's a road runner, baby  Like a snow ball, rolling down the side
Of a snow covered hill, it's growing
Like the size of the fish that the man claims
Broke his reel, it's growing
Like the rose bud blooming in the warmth
Of the summer sun, oh baby, it's growing
Like the tale by the time
It's been told by more than one, it's growing

Every day it grows a little more
Than it was on the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and grows
And where it's going to stop I'm sure that nobody knows

Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows
Oh, like the need in a guy to see his girl
When she's gone away, oh, it's growing
Like the sadness in his heart when he knows
That she's gone to stay, yeah, yeah, it's growing


Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows, nobody knows
Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows, it's growing now
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and grows

And where it's going to stop? I'm sure nobody knows
Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows
How it grows and it grows, yeah, yeah
  I didn't know what time it was
Then I found you
O, what a lovely time it was
And sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of may it was
I'll say it was grand
It was grand, to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own
I didn't know what year it was
Life had no prize
I wanted love, and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now
So grand, to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own
I didn't know what year it was
Life had no prize
I wanted love, and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now I'm leavin' my fam'ly
Leavin' all my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
On a new front page sky
My tears are salt water
And the moon's full and high
And I know Martin Eden's
Gonna be proud of me
And many before me
Who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest
Singin' my say
Shiver me Timbers
'Cause I'm a-sailin' away
And the fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
I'm driftin' on out
Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me, now
So swallow me, don't follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone
So please call my missus
Gotta tell her not to cry
'Cause my goodbye is written
By the moon in the sky
Hey and nobody knows me
I can't fathom my stayin'
Shiver me timbers
'Cause I'm a-sailin' away
And the fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
I'm driftin' on out
Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me
So come and swallow me, follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone
And I'm leavin' my family
Leavin' all my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
Upon a new front page sky
And shiver me timbers
'Cause I'm a-sailin' away Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
 
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot
  They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
When you're walking down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere, nowhere
On Broadway
They say the girls are something else on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you going to make some time
When all that you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime, that won't even shine your filthy shoes
On Broadway
They say that I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But, oh, they're wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here, guitar
I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway
On Broadway
But oh, they're wrong, I know they are
But I can play this here, guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway
Oh, on Broadway
Never going to quit, never going to quit my thing
Till I make it on Broadway
I'll be a big man, yeah
You're going to know my name
All up and down Broadway
Yeah, up and down Broadway
Dirty, filthy Broadway
Break your heart on Broadway

Everybody's going to know my name
Walk, walk, walk on by
Walk, walk Well, I'm going to raise a fuss, I'm a, going to raise a holler
I've been working all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, tried to make a date
The boss says, ""No dice son, you got to work late""

Sometimes I wonder what I'm going to do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and poppa told me
Son, you got to earn some money
If you want to use the car to go riding next Sunday
Well, I didn't go to work, I told the boss I was sick
You can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick


I'm going to take three weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm going to take my problem to the United Nations
Well, I called my Congressman and he said, quote
""I'd like to help you, son, but you're too young to vote""


Say the same thing, everyday, not going to work
Doing nothing, no, no
There ain't to cure for the summertime blues Just because I ask a friend about her, just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today, she thinks I still care

Just because I hang out at the same old places where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be, she thinks I still care
But if she's happy thinking I still need her, then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish, oh, where would she get such an idea? I open my arms to hold you
You turn away, you turn away
I feel it just like I told you
How can you turn away?
Oh things that we said last Saturday night
You turn away, you turn away
Now you wanna, now you wanna throw that away
How can you turn away?
It was true love
It was you and me
And the sliver moon
And the shining sea
It was new
But it felt to me
Just like love was supposed to be
Finally
Now your eyes won't meet mine
You turn away, you turn away
I never ever wanna taste that sweet wine again
How can you turn away? (turn away)
Turn away
How can you turn away?
How can you turn away?
It was true love
It was you and me
And the silver moon
And the shining sea
It was new
But it felt to me
Just like love was supposed to be
Finally
And after this love that I'm keeping for you
Has turned away and burned away
I'll dry these tears that I'm weeping for you
Take my turn to turn away yeah
Oh lover, oh no no
Turn away, you turn away
How can you turn away?
How can you turn away?
Turn away, turn away, turn away
Turn away, turn away, turn away yeah
Turn away, turn away, turn away
Turn away, turn away, turn away
How can you turn away?
How can you turn away, baby?
How can you turn away, no no no?
How can you turn away?
How can you turn away? Distant hands in foreign lands
Are turning hidden wheels
Causing things to come about
Which no one seems to feel
All invisible from where we stand
The connections come to pass
And though too strange to comprehend
They affect us nonetheless, yes
Once again a time of change
Oh the change makes music
And the children will dance
See the pieces of the picture
Rearrange themselves
It feels just like a symphony to me
With nothing left to chance
Just look over your shoulder
It's out of your hands, it's over for now
Leave behind what you can
You can always return
The rhythm remains unbroken, unspoken
But loud and clear
It's a slow vibration, migration
Oh Mystery muse, how I hunger for an answer
Unsung song, how I long to play the changes
Hidden rhythm, haven't I always been your dancer?
Sacred secrets of the meaning to my dreaming
Migration
Migration She is frenzied to the point of pain
She is counting up her list again
She won't satisfy another man
You understand
You can't cross the boundary beyond which she stands
He's disposed of all his inner mind
Donned his mask and left the world behind
He has cancelled all the checks he signed
So why be kind this time?
You can't see the picture of you in his hand
Now they've thrown out all the undesired
Morbid dreams behind a gay attire
They won't talk about the morning fire
So why aspire?
You don't want to be what they think is a man Limousine driver, big Cadillac car
Rich and famous no matter who you are, you are
I seen a rock'n'roll rider, oh, I seen a cinema star
Won't you to roll down the road, roll down the road
Roll down the, roll down the road with me?
Want you to roll down the road, roll down the road
Roll down the, roll down the road with me?
Deep into the night, blue velvet plush
Cut glass crystal, I mean it means so much, so much
Long cool fingeroos, soft tenderloin touch
Won't you to roll down the road, roll down the road
Roll down the, roll down the road with me, little one?
Want you to roll down the road, roll down the road
Roll down the, roll down the road with me, yeah?
Roll down the road with me, yeah baby
City sidewalk, shining wet with rain
Run through the runthrough babe, I said, one more again
Run through the jungle, fetch a lady glove
Kicking off a bundle, go on and give it a shove
Speak up don't you mumble, oh, who do you love?
Won't you to roll down the road, roll down the road
Roll down the, roll down the road with me, catcher?
Want you to roll down the road, roll down the road
Roll down the, roll down the road with me?

And never fails to say, get a job

And my girl never fails to see if there is any work for me

Preaching and cryin', tellin' me I'm lyin' about a job

Preaching and cryin', tellin' me I'm lyin' about a job
That I never could find
Get a job Well, it was about five till five on a Friday
We were all getting ready to go
The boss man started screaming
His veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
'Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping, I was jumping
And I had to get away

Some days you got to dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
You got to loosen up those chains and dance

Well, I was talking to my baby
Over a small glass of tea
She asked the loaded question
She said how do you feel about me?
Well, my mind was racing, I was pacing
But the words, they never would come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on
 

You got to loosen up those chains and dance, dance
Want you to loosen up those chains and dance with me I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumblin' down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour, oh yeah
I'm gonna wait 'til the stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
You are the only girl I know
That really oh, loves me so
In the midnight hour, oh yeah
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumblin' down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
Just you and I
Just you and I, yea
Just you and I, oh yea baby
Just you and I, oh yea
Just you and I, yea I do believe, I must believe
I think I can begin again
Become again the man I was back when
So I'm walking on your streets again
Feeling now as I did then
I've since become a different man
London Town, turn me around
London Town, carry me back
Oh, London Town, lost and found
And I feel like going back
I can remember lots of time and space
If I lose the name, still I know the faces
Time has come and left its traces
London Town, turn me around
London Town, carry me back
Oh, London Town, lost and found
And I feel like going back
When I've grown too old and dull to rock and roll
Like to hold on tight to you, darling
And when my fires have all burned out
I'd like to think I can still think about
The things I used to sing about
When I was spending all my time alone
By myself and on my own
Seldom seen and quite unknown
London Town, turn me around
Oh, London Town, carry me back
Oh, London Town, lost and found
And I feel like going back
Yes I feel like going back
Oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh whoa Someone turned the time on
Another day, dead and gone
A lifetime is slipping away, babe
But as far as I can see
That doesn't apply to you and me
We are high above the family tree
Hidden in the deep blue sea
Industry on parade
Punch a clock nine to five
The beginning is beginning to fade away
Ah, but look out from now on, baby
As far as the eye can see
Unafraid to be free
Shining on the silver sea
You and me
We got to be moving
Picking up, carry on
Lead your children by the hand
Carry on, carry on
Heaven knows I love you
Don't you know that it's true yourself yeah yeah
Looks like you and me baby dancing by the shining sea I'm been dying to tell you 'bout how it's going to be
You're going to give a your love to me
Love will last more than one day
That your lovely love will never fade away
That lovely love will not fade away, no

And my love is bigger than a Cadillac
I'll drive you and you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real, got to be real
'Cause you'll understand just how I feel, baby 
How I feel, got me feeling really good today, yeah

I'm been dying to tell you 'bout how it's going to be
You're going to give a your love to me
Love will last more than one day
That your lovely love will never fade away
That lovely love will not fade away, no

That your lovely love will not fade away
Never going to fade away I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again
And yet I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face
I guess I'm used to hear her say
Good morning every day
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman
And so easy to forget
Rather like a habit
One can always break
And yet I've grown accustomed to the trace
Of something in the air
Accustomed to her face Instrumental I don't wanna lose
This good thing
That I got
If I do now
I would surely
Surely lose alot
'Cause your love
Is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder
Lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock, on wood baby
I'm not superstitious
About you
But I can't take no chance
Got me spinning, spinning baby
Baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love
Is better
Than any love I know
I better knock, baby
Ain't no secret
That woman
Fills my lovin' cup
She sees to it
That I get enough
Just one touch
Is better
You know it means so much
Better knock back
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood Long distance information, give me memphis tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall
Help me, information, get in touch with my marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from memphis tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the mississippi bridge
Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in memphis tennessee
Last time I saw marie she's waving me good-bye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Try to put me through to her in memphis tennessee Tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why?
Why you make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry?
Can't help but love you 'til the day I die
Tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why?

Well, I got a crow I want to pick with you
Just like last time when the feathers flew
You got there honky tonking, kicking up your heels
Leaving me home with a hand full of bills
Can't live without you and you know it's true
There's no living with you so what'll I do
I'm going honky tonking, get as drunk as I can
Maybe by then you'll appreciate a good man, that's my friend


Well, I caught you honky tonking with my best friend
The thing to do was leave you and I should'a left then
I love you so much you but I still get sore
When you come home feeling for the knob on the door
I don't know I've heard saying
That every little dog is going to have his day
You'd better pay attention, don't you dare forget
'Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy dog yet Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool


There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you I know a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Oh, it's not on any chart
You must find it with your heart
Never Never Land
It might be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find
Never Never Land
You'll find a treasure if you stay there
More precious far than gold
For once you have found your way there
You can never, never grow old
And that's my place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your heart will fly on wings
Forever, in Never Never Land
And once you have found your way there
You can never, never grow old
So that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your heart will fly on wings
Forever, in Never Never Land
Never Never Land
Forever, forever I don't care if i got no money
I don't care if i got a dime
All i want to do is to dance with you honey
Please tell me you have the time
'cause i gotta get back on my feet again
Gotta get back on the street again
La, la, la
Well i don't care if i got no fame
All i want to do is to hold your hand
Don't care if nobody knows my name
'cause i just want to try the best i can (yes i do)
I gotta get back on my feet again
Gotta get back on the street again
La, la, la

And i don't know just what is going on among you

Gotta get back on the street again
La, la, la
Stand it up for me now momma It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
Putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
Ya, but it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
You want to make a lot of money and split this crazy scene
I wish I had a river and I could skate away on
Oh, I wish I had a river so high
I could teach my feet to fly away, yeah
I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
And I think, your's the only best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
She tried hard to help me, tried to put me at ease
She loved me so naughty, made me weak in my knees
Ya, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
Oh, I wish I had a river so high
I could teach my feet to fly away, yeah
I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
And I made baby cry, and I made my baby say goodbye
And I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
I could skate away on, I could skate away on What good is that happy lie?
All you wanted from the start was to cry, girl
It looks like another fall
Your friends they don't seem to help at all
Now, when you're feelin' kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man
It does you no good to pretend, child
You've made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like you lose again, my friend
So go on home and look up your rainy day man
Now rainy day man he don't like sunshine
He don't chase rainbows, he don't need good times, no
Grey days rolling, then you'll see him
I said empty feeling, Lord now you need him
All those noble thoughts, they don't belong
Can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just go call up your rainy day man
Now simple pleasures they all evade you
Store-bought treasures, Lord none can save you, no now
Look for signs to ease the pain
I said ask again, go on and pray for rain
It looks like another fall
Your friends they don't seem to help at all
Now, when you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man
All I'm askin' just to look up your rainy day man There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye
An' it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'rything's goin' my way
All the cattle are standin' like statues
All the cattle are standin' like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'rything's goin' my way
All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And a ol' weepin' willer is laughin' at me!
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'rything's goin' my way
Oh, what a beautiful day That's why I'm here You can play the game
You can act out the part
Though you know
It wasn't written for you
Tell me how can you stand there
With your broken heart
Ashamed to playin' a fool?
When one thing can be to another
It doesn't take any sacrifice
Oh, Father and Mother
And sister and brother
If it feels nice
Don't think twice
Just shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna work out fine
If you only will
Do as I say
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will
You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
Now what do you plan to do
With your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody
The way that you feel
You can feel it beginning to ease
I think its true what they say
About the squeaky damn wheel
Always getting the grease
Better to
Shower the people you love with love
Yes and show them the way you feel
I know Things are gonna be just fine
If you only will, what I like to do to you
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better, if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Shower the people you love with love

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel...

For auld lang syne Never ending circles – been spinning us around
We lost all our direction – when we passed the speed of sound
Now I hope you're feeling better – and I've lost my fear of heights
I've seen time and space together – gonna reach the speed of light
Don't you know that I've never had (such a feeling)
Don't you know that I've never had (such a feeling)
'Cause tonight – something's pulling us together like gravity
Let's take the ride – on a starship bound for eternity
'Cause tonight – something's pulling us together like gravity
Let's take the ride – on a starship bound for eternity
Don't you know that I've never had (such a feeling)
Don't you know that I've never had (such a feeling)
'Cause tonight – something's pulling us together like gravity
Let's take the ride – on a starship bound for eternity
'Cause tonight – something's pulling us together like gravity
Let's take the ride – on a starship bound for eternity Well, the secret of life is enjoying the passage of time
Any fool can do it
There ain't nothing to it
Nobody knows how we got to the top of the hill
But since we're on our way down
We might as well enjoy the ride
The secret of love is in opening up your heart
It's okay to feel afraid
But don't let it stand in your way, no no
Because everyone knows that love is the only road
And since we're only here for a while
We might as well show some style
Give us a smile now
Isn't it a lovely ride?
Sliding down, gliding down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
Now the thing about time is that time isn't really real
It's all on your point of view
How does it feel for you in there?
Einstein said that you could never understand it all
Planets spinning through space
The smile upon your face
Welcome to the human race, now
Isn't that a lovely ride? Oh, yeah
Sliding down it
Gliding down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
Isn't that a lovely ride? Ohh, la la, yes
See me sliding down
And gliding down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
Now the secret of life is enjoying the passage of time Limousine driver
Big cadillac car
Rich and famous
No matter who you are you are
I seen a rock n roll rider
I seen a cinema star
Chorus:
Won't you roll down the road
Roll down the road roll down the
Roll down the road with me
Want you to roll down the road
Roll down the road roll down the
Roll down the road with me
Deep into the night
Blue velvet push
Cut glass crystal
I mean it means so much
Long cool fingeroos
Soft tenderloin touch
Chorus
City sidewalk shining wet with rain
Run through the run through one more again
Run through the jungle
Fetch a lady's glove
Kicking off a bundle
Go on and give it a shove
Speak up don't mumble
Who do you love Sleigh bells ring are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
Beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is a bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we roll along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?, we'll say, No man, no
But you can do the job, when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?, we'll say, No man, no
But you can do the job, when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland, yeah
Walking in a winter wonderland When the setting sun – disappears from view
And the last rays of light – fade from the sky
When all around is darkness
And there is no way forward
Just hold yourself together
You will find yourself if a different place (x2)
'Cause outta sight is out of mind (x4)
And you will find yourself in a different place
You were there in a previous life
Enchanted gardens, sweet smelling blossoms
Slow your thoughts to a gentle pace
You will find yourself if a different place (x4)
'Cause outta sight is out of mind (x4)
Ancient mysteries explain themselves to you
Wise words soothe your troubled mind
Fantastic angels dance your tears away
Brings a smile to your wounded soul
You will find yourself if a different place (x4)
Out of sight – out of mind"
